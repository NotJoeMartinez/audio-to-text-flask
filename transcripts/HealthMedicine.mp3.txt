morning everybody
 so I don't know if you noticed but last night it was raining cats and dogs right almost stepped on a poodle
 I was pretty bad that your music today was By Request student ask that that I play a really quite remarkably good sort of melancholy piece by the John Coltrane quartet called Lonnie's lament now we're getting on toward finals week so I guess lamenting is probably appropriate so anyway that's what that was about let me talk about how things are going to start to wrap up and I want to get this on the record and keep getting it on the record cuz students get confused alright
 we have three more lectures in this segment before test 5 and means test 5 coming up pretty quick we have today's lecture on health and then a lecture on the economy electron politics and the next test is a week from Tuesday so it's just about 10 days out that is test 5 now you recall from the syllabus that you can complete the course with 5 I mean there are only five test the count out of the six everyone's lowest will be dropped and that lowest score can be the zero you get by just not taking the final which is fine so the question is do I have enough points and how do I know
 at the end of test 5 you'll have what I call a provisional total you'll have 5 test scores and you'll have Abbott points and let me remind you that there are still four Abbott points left to get there's one more Abbott and that could occur anytime between today and literally the last day of the term so therefore more Abbott points to get you can presume let's say that the magic
 that on the day of the that after the 5th test scores are posted you have 244 points there are four Abbott points left to get you'll have 248 there's nothing you can do not to get an a 243 is the cutoff so that could happen
 well there's another rabbit day if you get those four points at 2:44 you're done no need to take the final
 let's presume however that you have let's say 236 let's presume you get the for Abbott days that means the poor have a point that means of 240 your three points short of the a the question is what do you need to get on the final
 there are students who say easy peasy I just got to get three know you have to be at your lowest score by 3 to make the final count more than your lowest score so that you'd get that up so let's say you have 240 assuming the Abbott points
 and your lowest score is a 40 what do you need to get on the final 43 okay back to the final grades going up how could I not have gotten a b when I only needed three points excuse me so I want to make sure you understand that does that make sense your five best test scores will count and if you got five really good test scores and the Abbot points add up and you have the grade that you need no need to take the final now there's one other possibility that can occur let's say you have 220 points
 and you earned the baby cuz it be cut off I think it's 219
 it is not likely that it is mathematically possible to get an egg you'll need to beat your lowest test score by over 20 points in order to do that and that will not that's generally not possible so one of three things can happen in the run-up to the final you've earned the gray do you want
 and that's great you can get the grade you want by taking the final or taking the final just won't help if your if your if your grade is at the low end of a scale you got a low b or a low C you're not likely to be able to earn enough points on the final that beats your previous lowest test score by enough does that make sense and then there's no need to take the final father so that's that's how it shakes out does anybody have any questions on that at this moment you're going to hear this appeal for the next four five six lectures cuz I need to get it on the record okay
 believe it or not their students at don't come to class everyday and they sometimes listen to the recording anyway really any questions about anything to this point
 okay let's talk about how our world meets our needs these are the three sort of interest-based social institutions and I've got a lot of terms and definitions in a couple fairly lengthy digressions in this lecture let's get through the terms and definitions first I'm going to use the definition of Health that is provided by the World Health Organization it's fairly comprehensive definition health is a state of complete a state of complete physical
 a state of complete physical mental and social well-being complete physical mental and social well-being and is Lonnie's lament meant something to you you're probably not healthy I mean who is at the stage of the game it's a miserably cold day finals are coming up I just got my test scores from Tuesday and how much right
 things are a little loose
 and I think that it's useful to know that health and well-being is not just the absence of a disease I don't have a cold so I must be okay there's a lot going on in everybody's life that contributes to health and well-being the World Health Organization definition of Health accounts for that a state of complete physical mental and social well-being A culture-bound syndrome is a disease or disorder that can only be understood only be understood if you understand where it occurs and I've been harping all semester it's not just what but we're context comps A culture-bound syndrome is a disease or disorder that literally
 inscrutable are cannot be fully understood unless you understand the country or culture in which it occurs the best example of the off in the textbook example of culture-bound syndrome are the whole range of eating disorders
 which certainly are part of
 the contribute to not being mentally or socially well and the reason for that arguably is that in US culture we have rather particular istic understanding of what a not necessarily healthy but conventionally attractive conventionally attractive body looks like and it drives especially
 14 15 16 year old more than not Anglo females literally to distraction and in the Advent in the in the proliferation of social media websites there are even there even social groups that encourage anorexia make yourself look as thin as possible to call pro-ana website and then Facebook groups my colleague dr. Maloney had actually studied some of this stuff so you can you can look on her website and then Vita and find some research on this
 this really
 this really crazy stuff and it's a disorder that kills people and you cannot understand it if you don't understand the sort of hyper obsession
 and the body shaming that goes on on social media with celebrities even I can't remember who it was the other day that she was body shamed seriously in what Universe would have 14 15 or 16 year old think they needed plastic surgery for something I mean this is just the hyper
 obsession with conventionally attractive conventional attractiveness that contributes to the eating disorder range of of issues that are defined as culture-bound syndrome and let's just let it leave that leave it at that holistic medicine is a style of healthcare it's a style of primary care that accounts for Spirit mind and body so if your physician if your primary care doc nods toward holistic medicine he or she when you have your annual physical or or go to see him or her for something else will ask you run up to finals what's going on in your life other than you know ears eyes nose throat blood pressure and all of that in mind and body
 morbidity and mortality or quality life of quality of life indicators if you're going to move someplace moving to Lubbock you might want to know what's the morbidity and worth what are the morbidity and mortality rate morbidity root word morbid refers to illness
 what are the leading illnesses in this area allergies for one thing to the red dust that flows are that blows up across the landscape pretty much 24/7
 what is it what are the what are the things that people get sick from and then mortality refers to death the incidence of death in population how many out of a thousand die every year and from what you know what is the leading causes of death so morbidity and mortality rates are sometimes measured directly you know what is the you know how many new AIDS cases do we have or how many cases total do we have in the population what about the flu in a flu season is upon us and you will hear statistics about you know how good the flu shot is and what percentage of the population are suffering from it and so on that's what all this is about and their quality of life indicators when I talk about the infant mortality rate later in this in the in this lecture this will become a little more clear how do we look at incidence of illness and rates of death or life expectancy as quality of life indicators
 but it is the incidence of illness the definition of mortality is the incidence of death
 epidemiology is the study of the distribution of disease the study of the distribution of disease the Centers for Disease Control and prevention pretty much everybody that works there is in one form or another a statistician an epidemiologist or a healthcare provider where do we see higher incidences of where's the flu where is the latest measles outbreak where do we find increasing cases of sexually transmitted diseases
 that sort of thing has control and prevention is populated by epidemiologist to study the distribution of disease sex and gender is what
 the distribution of disease and even life expectancy is different for men and for women in the US women live longer depending on location depending on ethnicity anywhere from three to seven or eight years longer than men on average they also however are more likely to suffer from chronic long-term illnesses to put it bluntly and to overstate it but to at least give you an ocean of what's at the heart of this man die from things that women live with because women tend to tend to their health a little sooner than men do men might blow off you know symptoms of of heart disease and then suddenly die of a heart attack women may not and then they'll live longer but they'll take more medicine and I'll have more of a restricted lifestyle lifestyle so it's a trade-off
 women are also less likely to be employed in highly dangerous occupations farming in mining among others
 women also smoke less or have higher rates of non-smokers a higher percentage of women that don't smoke at all they don't drink as much and they also are not as aggressive and are as likely to die violently even though that's true among intimate Partners women are less likely to die violently than that so when you add all that up
 aggression and violence and lifestyle choices that's essentially what generates the difference in life expectancy between men and women
 social class is the heavyweight champion of quality of life and we talked about this at some length in the in the stratification unit a couple of segments ago wellspace Health it's really not any more complicated than that in the US we distribute the burden of the scarcity I'm Healthcare is a scarce resource not everybody gets or has access to everything they might possibly need
 and in other countries I mean that's true everywhere stew in Canada where everybody has access to sort of the base level of primary care but you will have to wait longer for surgical procedures and other things so the burden of that scarcity in the u.s. is born by the poor the poor bear the burden of the scarcity of healthcare and that plays itself out with life expectancy and incidence of illness clearly life expectancy among those who are live below the poverty line is quite a bit less race and ethnicity carries some of this the subgroup of the u.s. population that has the lowest life expectancy are African-American males that is because the leading cause of death
 for African-American males page 2240 is homicide and the the the disproportionate number of African-American males who died violently in their twenties and thirties reduces the average life expectancy such that it's actually under 70 years it's quite remarkable how that works out
 convert are in addition to that race and ethnicity as we've said many times before is also a carrier social class the wealth disparity that we noted through 4 weeks ago the 22 full difference in Anglo versus non-anglo wealth plays into this considerably
 that makes sense cuz all these things and in some ways that kind of environment certainly plays a role in well-being and overall health and again to overstate its lightweight but to put it bluntly enough that you sort of get the idea
 environmental hazards tend not to occur where rich people live
 Flint Michigan lead in the water supply a struggling municipality hit hard by a downturn in manufacturing
 such that the infrastructure the city essentially collapsed and the water supply was tainted and there are still recovering from the environmental hazards whether they be issues related to air quality or water quality 10 not to happen where wealthy people live so the overriding issue here in many respects is social class so are there any of that stuff yes
 less likely to die violently and also working Inlet less likely to work in extremely hazardous professions or I can patient
 what else
 okay
 well from a functionalist point of view this is this is kind of an interesting I mean I know on functionalism all through the course but this one's a little bit more interesting because it also builds I'm kind of a micro-level issue there are things that occur person to person that become embedded into our culture and the sick role is that we've already talked about how to roll is a roll is a series of expectations a role is a set of expectations associated with the label you happen to be wearing at the time I am professing at the moment and there's a level of there's a list of expectations that go into that brief the class on the upcoming exam tell him all about how grades are calculated all this kind of stuff that's kind of what you can expect of someone who does this those expectations are pretty much Universal you can expect that every teacher every hire educator if you will will keep you informed
 that kind of stuff for do just basic things but that's also true for not only Healthcare Providers but also people seeking Health Care the sick role was at is it it's a concept that was invented by a sort of Neo functionalist sociologists name Talcott Parsons in the forties and fifties and 1940s and 50s he taught at Harvard and it was his ta is job to translate it into English she was really hard I mean even speaking English but you wouldn't necessarily know that because it wasn't exactly clear are absorbed or born by people when you get sick
 it is dysfunctional for sick people to go to work or school they might infect other people they also might reduce their they're not going to be as productive and so the first rule in the sick role is stay home and take your medicine in other words Society grants and exemption
 for being sick stay home get well okay that exemption comes with a cost you have to pay for that exemption by taking your medicine
 doing everything you're supposed to do to try to get well you can't fake an illness and get an exemption you can't have an illness and refuse to try to get it treated and keep the exemption get the idea got to take your vitamins take your medicine do what you're supposed to do so that you can be re absorbed back into the functional Society illnesses dysfunction so that's where this macro micro thing comes in but is by and large a set of rules that are so deeply embedded that everybody understands that
 don't go to work and try to suck it up
 take your medicine and get better as soon as you can now let me just dip my toe over into conflict theory for a second all that well and good mr. smart doctor I first of all have to have a job that gives me the exemption or I don't run out of the door I've run out of sick days I also have to have money to buy the medicine and I also have to be able to get my kids taken at cetera excetera the ability to play by the Sick role rules is not always equally available to everybody else so I just wanted to get that on the table we're going to talk about conflict theory in a much different way a little bit later in the lecture
 so there are these expectations for being sick what happens when this happens what do you what's your next move when you wake up sick
 all of these things you claim the exemption but you hold up your end you're not faking it and you do everything you can to get better those are the rules for the role of the sick person
 there's an exemption but you have to also hold up your end with a set of expectations and those expectations are called the sick role
 Health Care Providers also have a role we expect that when we go to the doctor the doctor will provide us with wisdom and a plan and an accurate diagnosis they've been well-trained they've been certified we expect our Healthcare Providers to know what they're doing and we can expect that because we know they've engaged a fairly long process of learning
 to know what they're doing
 kind of interesting the role of a healthcare provider is very hierarchical
 on a micro level but I think macro in that it's spread out over the whole culture
 we allow Physicians to do things to us that no other human being gets to do right we sort of make ourselves vulnerable in exchange for their expertise and you know every once in awhile you hear horrible abuse has of that vulnerability with healthcare providers who who abused their position and abuse their patients
 it's interesting to me how the hierarchy plays out and how sometimes it can it can slip a little bit
 many many years ago when I first came to town I became the patient of a primary care doctor who was getting up in years and you retire so now what do I do I get a recommendation from people I know what the Health Sciences Center Dr so and so should be your new doctor will turns out he was a chair of the department family practice and a terrific doctor and a he's now gone in the next chair never mind anyway it's like when you go to the doctor for the first time. Please get there early cuz you got a stack of paperwork to fill out blah blah blah and you do all that and then you get ushered into the throne room of the Lord high God by the hand made of the doctor usually a woman and you can sit on the edge of the table and another handmade get you ready for the arrival of the guy in the white tornado and I'm just waiting to meet this new Doctor Who
 I know it's pretty hot snot position and I'm sort of lucky to have him and you know what that's like if there's nothing to do well at least now you can play with rice do they used to sneak around the room and look in the drawers just to see if there's anything interesting in and then you can hear the outside the door to see here are these fine and I saw I do that and I hear this
 on the door and I'm just stealing myself cuz I know the crew is going to come in here and do unto me right
 nothing happens
 until I hear again
 and I'm thinking all in about a millisecond this goes through my head you are a PhD trained social psychologists you are in a room by yourself there's a door in that room on the other side of it there seems to be someone who's going
 what's my next move
 come on
 he waited for me to invite him into his domain
 I got told me something right away about this guy and I was kind of interesting month or so later I was making a hospital call in my other life and I happened to see this guy with his gaggle of Med students and residents trailing down the hall and I stopped him and I said I want to tell you that I learned something about who you are by that initial impression and thought about just a silly knocking on the door that we were going to be we were at least going to relate to one another as human beings and a half
 you're still a human being even though you're in this hierarchical relationship and later on in the in my time is his patient he wanted to give me another medication and I take medication for blood pressure and heart issues I got bad cholesterol
 so he wants to put me on this other medication and I said look I take more pills in my shut-in come on do I need this thing so I think so but go read it there's a new article New England Journal
 I get access to the sacred texts if you wanted it's not you can go to Health Sciences Library look it up there okay
 I know how to read a regression model I looked and saw the probabilities on okay write the prescription Etc so there's this High Rocky and it's also kind of interesting when the Healer sort of flips that a little bit so all-in-all what I'm saying here is that we have the sort of micro level interactions with healthcare providers in individuals in our world when we get sick but deeply embedded in her actions go are the rules for the functionality in this functionality of illness that make sense
 that's functionalist take on health and Medicine
 wow we're blowing through this pretty quick aren't we
 okay now it's not. Comes the digression portion of our show and I'm trying not to trip over the microphone cord so you're just hold on a second
 all better okay
 from a conflict point of view all this functional medicine reproduces social inequality in a couple of different ways
 it clearly clearly have unequal access to Medical Care and I've shown you are already the impact of the Affordable Care Act and the subsequent changes that have been made in the provisions for the Affordable Care Act the uninsured percentage of the population in 2008 the end of The George W Bush Administration was about 17% the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014 almost immediately dropped the level of uninsured to about 10 or 11%
 in the previous immediate the previous two or three years the uninsured percentage of u.s. population is gone up to about 13% so you see this
 level of access that has a pretty significant impact on access health and well-being
 let me talk about the infant mortality rate for just a minute
 I think this gets to find again in another lecture but the infant mortality rate is the
 the level of success any country or culture has in keeping babies alive for a year that seems like job1 does it not if I were to judge what it's like to live in any place on Earth and had only one thing to give me information I would ask about its infant mortality rate
 what with regard to access to clean water reasonable food good Healthcare all those things that keep babies alive after they're born
 infant mortality rate again is the percent of the population of live births
 who's Liza and before their first birthday and in the US it's actually measure of a thousand how many per thousand in the US it's about six or seven
 per thousand which in the whole spectrum of developed countries in the developing world if you were to grade countries on this indicator the u.s. gets about a C+ we're sort of middling at this and part of the reason we're sort of middling at this is that average of 6 ish
 is not Universal not every subcategory in the US has six or so as their infant mortality rate that number 6 is as high as 18 or 24
 depending on where you live and whether or not you are white the infant mortality rate among non-white impoverished USA tees is three to four times higher
 how you can only draw one conclusion from that that is and the reason I hold on before you draw the conclusion the reason for this the leading cause of infant mortality is premature birth low birth weight the leading cause of premature birth is access to prenatal care and the leading limiter of access to prenatal care is money does this sound like a familiar story
 in a country that
 increasingly now is politically driven away from universal access to healthcare
 and if one of the consequences of that is a disparity in the birth rate by money by household well
 and we know that
 you can only draw one conclusion
 that the political agenda Driving Access
 to be stratified
 I have a hard time calling that a pro-life agenda now pro-life has come to mean in the US I oppose abortion Vine I think that's part of what you might consider a pro-life stance consider yourself pro-life that would be one way you could demonstrate that
 if you're a politician you got a lot of mileage on that
 by protecting The Unborn fair enough
 my protector that is if you are sort of hyper-vigilant about The Unborn and Implement policies that in fact restrict access to the mothers of The Unborn
 such that the infant mortality rate is higher among them
 your definition of pro-life is too narrow I had a deeply conservative religious person tell me one time it frustrates me that a lot of people who believe religiously is I do also believe that while like maybe get it conception their political agenda says it for all practical purposes ends at Birth
 caring about and providing resources for the born in their first year I think is also on the list of of what it means to have a pro-life agenda
 the infant mortality rate in the US is about a C+ in the developing world and if you look at that infant mortality rate by race and ethnicity you get a pretty clear understanding of why
 on average we're only doing about that well and the political agenda on Healthcare is driving that disparity so from conflict point of view the burden of scarcity of healthcare especially prenatal care born by the poor and the non-white
 is a pro-life issue it would seem to me as it plays out in Desperate infant mortality rates
 questions comments
 a fairly lengthy piece on Healthcare of social control the sound bite for this is what's called the medicalization of deviance the medicalization of deviance deviance means breaking rules
 we have come increasingly to understand
 different types of rules that people break to a great extent as not Badness so much but sickness and we give over the care and feeding of behavior that breaks rules to the healthcare profession
 the classic example of this is addiction addiction is regarded in the US as a disease understood I was a professional addiction counselor for a while in my life I get this
 the evidence for that assertion is not as obvious as most people think on the other hand it's extremely helpful if your therapist if I'm a therapist in Wise and someone comes to me where their lives have been wrecked by substance abuse and you are able to say this is not because you're necessarily A weak-willed and moral degenerate this is because your brain works differently than other people's brains you know and once you know that you we can teach you through social support and other things and maybe even some medication not to drink or drug at all
 and one of the limiting factors in the disease concept is that the only treatment that relates to that is absent it's sort of like if you're a diabetic you abstain from certain kinds of foods and you take insulin same thing in other countries of the UK addiction treatment specially alcohol addiction treatment that maybe you can drink less harmful than maybe you can drink less and in ways that don't wreck your life I mean the diagnostic criteria for alcoholism if I drink if you're an alcoholic or alcohol abuser if the way you drink creates chaos in your life if after taking the first drink you cannot accurately predict whether or not you'll take one more and get home safe or whether one is not enough
 for one is too many and ten or not enough and you wind up breaking something hitting somebody or going to jail you know if you can't predict what will happen after the first drink we need to talk about drinking at all not so much how can you be more accurate about your prediction for the first drink if you can teach yourself to just drink one over whether or not alcoholism is a disease but it is also the medicalization of breaking things hitting people etc etc that's an example of that
 another interesting example involves the pharmaceutical industry not to mention the opioid crisis what I meant I'm going to deal with it and it in a couple of different ways but I'm in the opioid crisis if you read up on that is just you know I'm steroids the point I'm trying to make here
 actually because of the opioid crisis the life expectancy for white men has gone down in the last couple years for the first time in decades that's what's kind of interesting to anyway
 use your sociological imagination for a minute
 take a guess at either the specific drug or the class of drugs that was the most widely prescribed
 in the decade 1965 to 1975 the most widely prescribed pharmaceutical product of drug it might be
 what would you say
 not an antibiotic you would think that wouldn't you because we haven't legally take a lot of antibiotics
 the drive was was Valium
 the specific drug it was the most widely prescribed it was the one pharmaceutical product for which the most prescriptions were written during a 10-year. Why was that
 Valium is designed to treat anxiety it is almost never prescribed
 to anywhere near the extent anymore because also some dangerous side effects of Valium plus a drink equals like four or five what would be otherwise drinks and can actually cause it can bring on alcohol poisoning
 in any case it was designed to treat anxiety
 it was prescribed vastly just in vastly disproportionate numbers to middle-aged middle-class off of white women because they were essentially drag to the doctor by their husbands or significant others and said he would fix her she's driving us nuts she's just anxious all the time
 Valium will settle that out oh my gosh
 the house is on fire
 marshmallows
 okay
 okay
 I've been up the car
 that's what it does
 here's the interesting question if we as a culture fix a medical problem
 with a pill it enables us to avoid asking what else might work
 enables us to avoid asking really nasty questions if we fix female anxiety with Valium for a decade
 we don't have to ask the question why are women so anxious
 does it have anything to do with the wage disparity the inability to get into Elite universities once in college the inability to major in engineering etc etc etc etc
 I think Valium setback feminism 10 years cuz instead of saying I want I'm going to stand here and beat the store down in engineering or Ministry or law or medicine
 okay
 I'll go be a teacher
 or something like that or I'll find a husband and get out of your way Etc now I'm again overstating all of this for a fact but I am convinced that that decision so prolifically prescribe Valium setback feminism 10 years helper look it up that's what they're talking about
 what is a different exam and I don't want to talk about a middle-aged woman in crisis and anxious over location and I talked about a nine-year-old kid in your garden-variety 4th grade class usually it's Johnny although not always
 Johnny just freaking love school he loves all the things you can do at school and likes to try to do them all at the same time or in no particular order but one after the other holy cow and Johnny get off the desk back to where you belong
 okay
 what's this kid's trouble
 ADHD right
 before I go one second longer into this fairly lengthy digression that becomes deeply personal in a little while
 I will acknowledge and celebrate the fact and I don't know who you are but I know there are people in this room whose lives have been saved his academic lives have been saved by methylphenidate like medication
 Val Ritalin Ativan many other
 can we have fixed the problem in lots of ways Johnny can learn better Johnny is more compliant
 pharmacologically methylphenidate is a stimulant
 who's the guy that thought or the woman researcher that was out jogging one day pondering what kind of pharmaceutical intervention could we do for these kids are just hyper Heroes giving them a stimulant would work
 what
 what stimulates inhibitions is what it does it's a it's an elegant Theory and a very workable solution in many ways I mean there are lots of other problems with but here's the deal here's the Crux of the matter
 when we solve that problem that way Johnny can't play by the rules in school and it has any has trouble learning because he don't play by the rules
 once again we don't have to ask a much more interesting question to me that is do these rules make sense
 you see almost no ADHD medication in a Montessori School very little of it in Europe
 public education that makes the 70th percentile the gold standard in other words gravitating everybody toward the main
 pulls people up and also bores other kids to death and you know maybe maybe Johnny just need something else to create and generate interest so he doesn't find other thing so freaking interesting
 is my point
 couple of personal Stories the day I was given for the day I should say that I
 reliably acknowledge that I earned a PhD it was May something-or-other 1994 and that date is memorable because of something else that happened that day and at Purdue University was getting ready in the staging area I hate commencement exercises by the way I've only gone to one faculty commencement I've only been a faculty member commensurate extech once and it was at gunpoint
 almost cuz they just drive me nuts they're just I can't sit still that long I just can't and especially you know in the role of Faculty anyway my mother made me go I want to take your picture when you go across the stage we have a picture of you at every other of these include
 okay mom so I rent a gown we're getting stage and two really every single word of the story is absolutely accurate in just this way which is sort of stunning and he discovers couple really official looking for do guys not in the crappy you know generic rental doctoral gown that you get for 40 bucks they had the $1,000 if you know full blown your cards right yeah we need to talk to you for a minute oh my god did they find out
 they said the guy in line alphabetically and then I instantly know it's not about me which I hate when it's not about me
 this guy has done something no human being in human history
 to that point has ever done and I will add that I've kept track of this no human being in human history since has ever done this guy his name is Harry kloor kloo are you can look him up he's all over the Internet he earned that day he was given two phds that he learned simultaneously
 any earned them are you ready for this theoretical physics and analytical chemistry holy crap not just a PhD in each of those but he earned them at the same time simultaneously New York Times in the parking lot and I'm in line behind this guy he goes out to the stages they did this 10 minutes thing about this guy right and then at all finishes everybody's clapping and kotch here we go
 and until a second ago I thought getting a doctor it's a big deal it would give those things out so I go out tonight
 my mother is sitting right over there and get my picture taken and I'm thinking to myself you were right Mom you can always do better
 and then of course we got to go sit down for the rest of the interminably long spring commencement at Purdue University like 59,000 people that seen going across the stage and I really get the big cheer for the whole time right
 he came prepared not only took fist up two phds he's banging on a GameBoy I'm going that's pretty smart and here's the punchline Harry doc clear you can look him up you think he was teaching at MIT by not know it was a screenwriter for science fiction is a rockstar, consort of the original Sheldon Cooper in a way
 I think Eric this is me Thea Rising I think Harry kloor did what he did in par
 because he didn't get enough Ritalin when he was a kid and some teacher or body of instructors taught him how to Channel all of that energy into something no human being in history before or since ever done so it leads me to wonder
 what might we be losing in exchange for what we gain at the 70th percentile that's my point fair enough I brought some props then this at this next story is is really a tribute to primary Educators so hang on a second
 I have in my possession
 my first grade report card I also have in my possession in a box in my office every single report card I ever got from kindergarten I am not kidding through college my mother save them and when we cleaned out their house a couple years ago after we lost them both I found them a lot of stuff. This is this is first grade for me and this whole list and what did I get here and reading and arithmetic satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory said he needs to improve it not too good in music and now we have attitudes and behaviors over here almost always part of the time
 attitudes and behaviors what do we got part of the time
 does Natan careful work part of the time is resourceful in you so free time part of the time
 it's thoughtful and considerate of others part of the time is developing self control part of the time
 pets first grade
 on the bottom of this it says promoted to second grade and it gives the room number of where my second grade experience will be and I looked at this again I'm telling you the absolute truth today for a change every single detail is true I see that I am promoted to second grade and will be in room 118 and I know from my school that room 118 is the dungeon of the Wicked Witch of the West
 she was known affectionately in a good Christian way as old lady Evans old lady Evans she's one of these teachers with you know tight grey hair sort of squarish
 build formidable shoes writes on the chalkboard and you can wiggle or triceps you know what I'm talking about and I'm going
 I walk into the back of my house back door climb up the stairs throw this on the floor and say to my mother I got a lady Evans next year she said pick that up
 thank you pick that up should know you have mrs. Evans and I requested her
 not only am I consigned to the to a cell my mother set me up
 so 2nd grade starts five six weeks into the thing mrs. Evans calls me up to the desk during silent reading not for the first time and says
 hella tough day not so much you don't like reading I love reading
 you don't like taking Jane not so much
 oh oh oh oh Dixie Sally
 jump puff jump jump jump jump up jump not perfect this is the first grade reader and I wasn't second grade that's not that much different
 she said I want you to go back to your seat and continue reading but I want you to read this
 this is Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe and all of a sudden
 now mrs. Evans today this was in 1960 she would probably be
 sanctioned in some way for deviating from the standard curriculum that puts kids at the 70th percentile instead she gave me a book
 and made me love reading now this isn't the exact copy of that book but it's the vintage book that she gave me I bought it on eBay just be a prop for the class and I vividly remember going I want to read that boy we got phone's going off all the time today don't we
 I was just getting to the good part 2
 I am fairly certain that had I not been a student of old lady Evans and it had not been 1960 that the place where most Ritalin prescription star would have been of referral from a teacher and a parent of a child who gets referred for this reason in Texas you can actually be investigated for child neglect if you don't take the child to the doctor wait a second then I just talked about access to healthcare
 we don't ask the other question does that rule makes sense or are there other ways of settling kids down I'm just going to leave that open but I will tell you one other thing
 fast forward this is a tribute to secondary to primary Educators fast forward in December and in January that next year I was working at a YMCA answers a nonprofit organization funded by United Way and because I was sort of a employee I was a lifeguard we all got conscripted to be wait staff at the United Way dinner that here
 pick up dinner for the United Way and on that program now this is now this is this is 15 years later
 on the program is that year the United Way was giving lifetime achievement awards to local educators
 and I on the list of those receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award is the now really really really old lady Evans in a wheelchair you know so I go up to her and I go I told her my name and I said you may not remember I remember you she said school she starts crying I start crying and it was one of the coolest moments of my life
 and if on your list of Heroes
 you don't have a primary educator redefine hero
 cuz I don't think I'm where I am but four in a small way her thing and I've been doing this presentation for decades and about eight or nine years ago I thought I know how to use the Google so I just Googled her name and I don't know that this is true but I do know that there is an Edith Evans Memorial Library in Laona Wisconsin small town up in Wisconsin and I don't know who else it could be so pleased and Sheet they said I don't know the records all burned this is a new library
 and I did the arithmetic and it works
 and I'm just pretending that it's true and I cannot think of a better way to honor a primary educator then to name a library in her honor
 the medicalization of deviance what we gain and what it cost fair enough
 I don't know how your transition from that to a discussion of HIV but we're going to try
 so anyway I thank you for your for your attention on that whole thing and anyway
 HIV
 is one of those diseases that is not only descriptive of a set of symptoms it's also on the first secondary class when I buy listed hiv-positive is a list of sort of socially consequential realities in your life the essence of this presentation I think I told you what my favorite Bible verse is didn't I
 it's a Hezekiah 3:16 which isn't in the Bible but should be and heck I've been doing this long enough I can say what I would be in the Bible don't you think people at the Council of Nicea said what couldn't be like at this being there but not the ideal be the enemy of the good
 HIV shows up in the US in 1980 or so and the people who do really really good public health research at the Centers for Disease Control all the epidemiologist I told you about a little while ago they figured out pretty darn fast that this was a new bug that seem to attack the immune system and it was creating in those individuals so compromised things that we hadn't seen in a long time one of the most of the early initial sort of red flags that you might have HIV which stands for the human immunodeficiency virus was this sort of really unusual and pretty aggressive skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma also it up a version of pneumonia that was especially virulent that apparently if your immune system is compromised in this way by this virus you were especially vulnerable to these two things and we also know
 that's pretty fast that the subgroups that were especially affected by this where we tended to see it the most immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean enter Venus drug users in gay men men have sex with men people share needles with each other using intravenous illegal drugs and refugees as it were so we got pretty clear on that and they started to figure out well this is a bug that is eventually failed but it sort of takes its time about it right
 and so they develop some early modalities you charge the unknown in terms of the known and we have other viruses act that sort of way into the treatment modality it didn't work very well and then somebody was jogging one time and said you know maybe we got the theory wrong maybe this isn't the sort of slow-moving Death By A Thousand Cuts kind of virus maybe this thing is a nuclear bomb and the reason it takes so long to kill somebody to kill a person with this nuclear bomb is that the human body is a pretty effective bomb shelter it really really does fight to the death against that and that's what turns out to be the case has a nasty ass virus
 and the human immune system is also
 pretty badass and so they started developing a modality that now has evolved over the last 20 years or so such that being hiv-positive disease it can be managed course the drugs are expensive so there we go
 but I got to thinking about that
 I wonder if the subcategories of those who were initially affected by HIV were not in fact immigrants IV drug users and gay men but if they were in fact the Sons and Daughters of members of Congress we might have figured that theory out a little quicker now that sounds cynical little bit but you kind of get the idea we figured out what the vectors were
 we also could have done something we chose not to do and that was try to intervene on the IV Part D i d drug part
 the federal government funded a study that was published in 1998 that measure the efficacy of needle exchange programs and it flew in the face of I mean that they somehow got the money to do this in in back-channel ways because it is then and still is it legal for the federal government to fund research on needle exchange programs that what does that mean it means that people are IV drug users can safely exchange their used needles someplace for clean so that they don't get a sharing these dirty needles
 and
 the results of the study is published in 1998 which are still the case because we've had other studies replicate this although they had to use money other than where you mostly get money for public health issue funding
 two things happen why should say one thing happens in one thing doesn't happen
 the one thing that doesn't happen is that IV drug use does not decrease neither does it increase it just stays the same needle exchange programs are available and we tracked those who use them their drug-using does not go down doesn't go up either what does go down in blood-borne diseases you can get when you stick a needle in somebody else's bloodstream into yours as it were not the case is that needle exchange programs create an interest in becoming a drug addict oh it's Saturday I just got an email or a text message or a Facebook notification that there's a needle exchange program at the Presbyterian church so what am I going to do well I'm going to drop the cat off at the vet pick up the dry cleaning and start using heroin
 trans not to happen that way
 what does happen is it we save lives and it is estimated
 that's something like 20,000 to like 20% of the HIV cases that are blood-borne through needle exchange could have been prevented we're talking about
 several million people and at about a million dollars a case for healthcare countless millions of dollars if we let not the ideal be the enemy of the good witch change programs are going to condone drug use they don't they don't make any Judgment at all about drug use what they do is help us be safer
 help us
 save lives
 and if we know how to do something that we know saves lives and for political reasons we collectively agree not to do it there is only one inescapable conclusion to be drawn those lives that we could otherwise save by doing this aren't worth saving end of story
 we live in the world we have to create
 questions
 well on that happy note go write a thank you note to somebody who taught you 2nd 3rd or 4th grade today thank you very much
