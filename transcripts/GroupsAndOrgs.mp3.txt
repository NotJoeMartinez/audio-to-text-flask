good morning everybody
 okay so this question might be on the test I got you quiet
 what did that hat say to the scarf
 you just hang around I'll go on ahead
 okay I have a couple of really important announcement so I need you to stop texting stop using Facebook and just give me your undivided attention I'm going to start lecturing you can just go back to what you were doing okay
 this is the third of for presentations in the section and the second test is a week from today week from next Thursday I believe it's October 3rd and in this room same time same station as a review for it at 4 on Wednesday next week I am leaving town tomorrow for 8 to 10 days it sort of indeterminate right now so I will not be in Lubbock on Tuesday and that's a class. We will not hold formal class the class will not meet on Tuesday what you have instead and I've already posted it is I posted an audio recording of the social structure and interaction lecture that was recorded last spring it's the same material
 now don't get tripped out because in the announcements for that lecture it's going to talk about a test on a day that you're not going to take a test cuz it was recorded last spring I totally get tripped up on that last year anyway listen to the lecture take notes that way the Tas will have office hours next week as usual and weight call now Haley is going to hold extra office hours on Tuesday during class time in this classroom so if you want to conduct a review with Haley or go over a test she will buy me one who got the classroom as well use it so Haley will be probably in a mostly empty room and she will not be available to answer your questions in that way I'll be available on email but I can't guarantee a fast answer I'm simply I simply need to be away and I'm going to be away and I apologize for that I will also not be here on teste de Elias and Haley will take care of that
 just pretend you attend the University of Phoenix next Tuesday same thing okay just the audio recording is already and it says in big letters this was recorded last spring so course the announcers don't mean anything everybody got it
 are there any questions about yes
 I said the review for the exam is at 4 on Wednesday in the media and communication building room 281 that's where they all are I had to get those rooms last March I'm not kidding
 all set so I won't see you for you know 10 days are better I'll next be here the day we start the stratification segment I think I'm about October 8th or something like that
 any other questions
 fair enough
 I will I'll send out send the same email that I always send plus a paragraph that just summarizes what I just told you probably today or tomorrow
 nobody nobody is just looking askance and going I miss you so much nevermind
 alright let's move into this piece on groups and organizations and the lecture outline looks like this and I'm reversing the order of what I'm presenting cuz I have a very lengthy and important segment on Conformity becoming more relevant by the day I think I want to spend a little time I promised you when we were talking about the dead white guys that I would tell the little more deeply into the work of Max Weber he's a real snoozer I'll tell you that
 one of his more important contributions to the study of our social world is his rather complex and rigorous analysis of organizations and for this piece I'm simply going to ask you to imagine a complex organization with which you have more or less daily contact let's call it Texas Tech University
 he gave us all kinds of descriptions and characteristics of bureaucracies not necessarily
 the best of all worlds arguably it does produce functionality so he's doing here essentially cuz he's taking start of a mezzo or mid level of analysis and it's not quite macro it's not quite micro but he's arguing that all bureaucracies do this and so he sort of leaning in the functionalist Camp here if you want to know what this is about just generally
 Weber argued that the more of these five characteristics you have the more bureaucratized is your world your world is more bureaucratized if it's characterized by high levels of division of labor hierarchical Authority written rules and regulations in personality and security okay let me talk about what each of those that want you to imagine that were talking about Texas Tech University
 let me Begin by arguing that there are much much much simpler forms of social organization the simplest form of Socialism of social organization and we'll talk about this much later in the term are hunting and Gathering societies there only two jobs in a hunting and Gathering Society quick what are they
 almost no hierarchy of authority because the women do the Gathering the men do the hunting it is equally necessary that both of those be done that's the simplest form of social organization we have them on planet Earth there, they're hard to get to but they're really interesting to study
 the opposite of that are bureaucracies
 highly specialized division of labor there are people who do jobs at this University that I don't want
 that would be most other jobs I love the one I've got there people who do jobs at this University that I am incapable of doing at gunpoint like messing with the computer system although I could crash it
 and that's it there seems to be people on the campus for whom that is their job right but I love is when we get an email saying that the internet's down what
 we actually got an email saying the internet is back up
 there are people that
 operate payroll Human Resources traffic and parking building and grounds and all Weber is arguing here is that the more you divide up the work
 the more bureaucratized is your world you have run into this how long it takes to get a real person
 through voice mail through waiting in line and all of that do called traffic and parking recently I know dr. cook why would we ever have to call traffic and parking we never break rules never mind
 division of labor is a characteristic of bureaucracies I don't have to know what 99% of the other people who do work in this organization do
 they don't have to know how to do what I do
 but we all fit together in a complex organization division of labor is a key characteristic of bureaucracies
 hierarchical Authority that means the authority structures it's like a ladder okay and this
 the object of the game is to maintain smooth communication and avoid chaos
 I know who I report to my immediate supervisor is the department chair for name is Christina bradatan by the way she's a very good scholar on climate change and international migration if you have a complaint about me
 your first source of redone redress is the next step up on the high road you could send an email to presidents was going to ask if you wanted to but if you send it to president that ttu.edu you won't even see it one of his people will see it and if it's important they'll alert him and if you send an email about how terrible your sociology classes you might get an email back that says contact the department chair
 my department chair reports to the dean his name is Brett Lindquist he's the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and that's the next step up the ladder you need to know who these people are
 thought it was kind of interesting that even Dean's get reviewed and there is a student on the Dean's Review Committee beans get reviewed by there for their performance and on the committee there's the student I think that's it because there's a sort of puts the hierarchy a little bit more level. She reports to a Dean the dean reports to the senior vice president for academic Affairs his name is Michael Galleon and he's also known as the Provost he supervises all the dean's he is the one ultimately that signs off on faculty promotion and anything having to do
 anything having to do with
 wireless microphones in their volume
 anytime you do it instruction faculty at the academic portion of the University dr. Michael Galleon is the Provost he is also first among equals of all of the vice presidents there's a vice president for student affairs a vice president for building and grounds I mean there's a half a dozen or so vice president sending their senior vice president and chief assistance to assistant Chiefs and so on
 but you need to know that in a complex organization there's a hierarchy of authority and anytime you need redress in an organization stick to the high-ranking fair enough
 we have also written down the rules and regulations
 the policy and procedure manual at this University is probably this high is anybody read it. All of it have you read stuff that's important to you maybe
 generally I read an operating policy when one changes and we all get the email about it or when I get an email that says failed me for the last time I didn't I screwed up how could you not know that it's in the old p
 that's what Opie's are for there to remind you that you were warned essentially but I've been operating policies are designed to standardize
 both behavior and goods and services
 who's got a job
 that quite frankly is easily done by somebody else in a day or two sort of a entry level job in a restaurant or something like that to watch a video on how to interact with people
 or know of a job of such like hello my name is Steve how may I give you excellent service today
 I use a flower shop once in awhile and they answer their phone such-and-such flower shop how many I brighten your day today it's a script and you know I am down the written down to standardize goods and services and to be a reference point for employees Behavior employees way of work all of these are characteristics of bureaucracies division of labor written rules and regulations to go together
 they are generally elaborated in Human Resources policies and procedures that is in personality that is to say in a complex organization that is highly bureaucratized it doesn't matter or at least it's not supposed to matter if your uncle is the president
 it's not supposed to matter if your uncle is a dean and if you work like what I do and you create a hostile environment in the classroom but I should be cut some slack because of who I know
 I wouldn't begin to say that this never happens that people don't get extra chips at the redress table if they know somebody but in a complex organization in a bureaucracy that runs bureaucratically to be a little bit redundant
 hiring firing promotion demotion for getting written up punished rewards have at least theoretically nothing to do with your personality or the people you know
 always a nice guy will cut him some slack I mean that happens but theoretically it's not supposed to visit is an example of a characteristic that
 that sometimes causes problems and complex organization see if your spouse or child works the same place you do or specially in your department now in our department we have a married couple they're married to each other and they work in our department they're both associate professors and there are special rules for example when one of the other of them would come up for tenure or promotion that the other would have to recuse themselves and so on there's a faculty member in the history Department whose husband is the associate Dean for faculty Affairs he's the one that he sent you early signs off initially on tenure and promotion so it's kind of a big deal it causes an extra in fact there's probably an operating policy I could look this up I suppose on the nepotism question it's not forbidden it's not exactly welcome because it really does
 it creates personality problems in an organization that is characterized by impersonality
 it finally security
 this means you can't be hired a fire arbitrarily just because you disagree with the boss you're not supposed to be able to be fired specially in what it was this is especially well Illustrated in the setting you are in right now anytime someone is hired to do my job they're typically hired at the rank of what's called a assistant professor and that's an entry level position on a tenure-track
 that means that after 5 years that person's scholarship teaching and service will be reviewed far more rigorously than it is every year where all of us are reviewed on the basis of our publishing are teaching and our citizenship that happens every year review can have one of two outcomes one you will be
 deemed worthy of tenure you will have earned tenure and that means you don't have to have another review like that like forever or if your record is such as does not meet the standards especially around here and scholarship you be given a one-year contract you have one year to find another job essentially
 now once a person in my position is tenured it's much harder for us to be fired now that is not to say there aren't things that I could do I could I could say one sentence in a lecture like this direct it at a student to denigrate or humiliate them and because it's recorded because others are probably recorded depending on what I said
 I'd be fired by the end of the day rightly so you know
 but I can't be fired for telling you something
 that runs contrary to what's currently going on in the University I am under the guise of academic freedom I am empowered without threat of being fired for what I think or say as long as I can tie it to a concept in the course so I can talk about Karl Marx that's why I can make jokes about religion as long as they make a point it's why I can't even call into question the
 they used to call into question the Justice component to a policy like Medicare for all it's why I can critique the lack of it
 by arguing that it promotes a level of inequality that might be dangerous right I get to do that to challenge your thinking
 and there are times
 I think it was a thing that I can't remember exactly what the detail that's what I was having a conversation before I was 10 years old with a faculty member who essentially was about my age then and had my rank back I've been promoted to full professor and that's as far as I ever want to go trouble with a full Professor is you can't figure out how to empty them what's their full never mind I'll get to the good stuff here in just a second friendly conversation about something is going on in Austin and I was tempted to write an email to the governor and I was talking about it to my senior colleague and he said you know if this is still a hot issue next year after your tenured go ahead and do it
 because there's no guarantee that an email like that because we all work for the state you couldn't guarantee there would be no consequence even though I protection statutes which is going to be very interesting to see what happens in the next couple of days isn't it anyway security means you can't be fired over we can't just be fired because someone doesn't like you because you disagree with the boss in a complex organization and in a highly bureaucratized bureaucracy that make literally no sense at all questions
 box Vapors scheme on the ideal type bureaucracy
 this looks like flash card City on this lecture done it kind of right
 alright let's talk about things that are more micro-level the groups to which we belong the types of groups in the kinds of causes and consequences of group dynamics
 a primary group is the group to which the types of groups to which we feel emotional attachment it could evolve that your roommate or if you live in an apartment the three of you or so would be, kind of primary group you have a kind of both procedural and also kind of emotional dependency on one another the most obvious example of a primary group is your immediate family mom dad Junior says Poppin spot that's the best example that I have a primary group we generally get emotional support from our primary groups we give it back the rules in a primary group tend to be informal
 there are not typically written rules and regulations although dr. Sheldon Cooper had a roommate agreement that was 47 pages long you know
 Connecticut primary good for groups to which we feel most deeply tied emotionally the rules and regulations for membership
 are informal and you see you typically inherit your membership in a primary group or you choose carefully the people with whom you live Etc secondary groups are groups primarily concerned with Goal attainment I'm a part of this group because I have to get something done I have a group to which I am going and Haley is to the end of next month we are going to go to the annual meetings of the society for the scientific study of Religion and the religious research Association wow
 they meet secondary groups tend to meet sporadically but regularly every day and there are no formal meetings together groups or tend to be formal meeting these two groups meet once a year and I will catch up with old friends that I won't see you again until next year when it's in Pittsburgh Etc
 which is in St Louis and since the Cubs got eliminated from the playoffs last night
 there's a small chance that if the Cardinals make the World Series and the record of the American League World Series participant has a better record than the game 3 of the World Series tonight on there
 that's a digression
 the meeting is a part of the scientific study of Religion the religious research Association of secondary groups are primarily concerned that I'm taking a piece of research on religious tattoos that very few people have seen that we're going to put out into the academy for critique and that's what the object of what I do is all about this meeting until I get a better example of a secondary group that's obviously more relevant to your experience is this class fairly large number of people
 Meats on a schedule it has a starting point and an endpoint I'm not sure what the date of the final exam is in this class but after that is over we're done our group goes out of business I'll miss you
 oh I will but you'll move on and I'll move on and it won't be a great emotional thing so go interaction usually closed-ended I think I asked anybody in the band
 another example of a secondary group however the horn section might become more primary hard to say I mean these are not rigid categories
 hey a little scheme here it's on the next page primary and secondary groups these are just characteristics and some examples and you know this is a more or less typology small number of people involved. Personal continuous long-duration song A sporadic interaction short-duration labor union college class military unit not maybe a squad would be different if smaller group like that might become more primary so police horse might be different but your partner and so on might have a more primary role in your life away of characterizing primary and secondary groups questions to this point
 alright let's talk about
 Amore nebulous dichotomy of groups in-groups and out-groups will give you the definitions and in group is a group to which we are attracted
 to whom we are drawn or to which we are drawn we want to be a part of that group and health group is a group
 toward which we feel cement agonism or we are repelled in some play in some sense we don't want to be a part of that group
 these tend to be a significant source of drama in Middle School's get the idea
 who's ever imagined who can imagine an instance of what I would call Middle School drama over the seeking to become or getting kicked out of an in-group of sorts do we know what these in groups are what's the name of it in group in a garden-variety torturously unpleasant Middle School
 Indian group
 if I under speak English just give me one
 high school I don't care
 yeah athletes have high stabs High status groups let's call it that because it's hard to be
 and just a little aside athletes and others who are in groups that require that level of work ethic and ability to hold complex thoughts in their heads tend to do if they apply that pretty well if they are flying so high status groups athletes are these typically men or women high-status athletes in high school typically the football team typically to the to the boys football team
 the volleyball group
 softball sure cheerleaders 2
 here's what's interesting about high-status in groups in a lot of high school culture
 for a fair percentage of those who rule the hallways in high school tough guys Mean Girls where do you want to call
 that's the high-water mark of their life
 it never gets much better
 High status
 halt ruling high school kids grow up to me to be a great Administrative Assistant cuz they follow rules and try to get along with people that are important
 the edgy ones cure cancer the class clowns become College professors Etc I'm not talking in exclusive Global terms there's just a higher tendency for the most successful in group types in American high schools
 solidarity
 band are you in the band sir are you in the Band by chance know so he's okay
 but yeah you know not
 they're not strong and tough
 they make noise while being windy or dexterous yeah band nerds theater chess club
 druggies
 I don't know you get the idea
 what High School drama is hard to live with in some ways isn't it am I just am I overstating that
 who's glad to be out of that mess of course
 in-groups and out-groups this will become important I'm going to loop back to the imagery I'm leaving in your head like oh thanks for reminding me of that day in middle school when that in group guy kick me out
 where do I buy Conformity here in a fairly lengthy and consequential piece in just a few minutes
 in-groups and out-groups really do demand and come and Conformity for entree and there's a level of Conformity toward keeping out about groups that will also have something to do with kind of your Social Status
 put on about reference groups I like reference groups I live with a reference group my colleagues in my department these are groups to whom we look for evaluation groups to whom we look for evaluation how it could be that one of the in groups and in your garden variety High School could be a kind of reference group but the illustration to get the idea into your heads is this who can remember last Thanksgiving dinner
 our Christmas dinner just a family dinner of sorts when you had extended family members over who's coming up
 can you imagine people around your Thanksgiving dinner table and let's make it the year we really should we really stepped up and there were a dozen of us imagine those people on that day with you will meet for the first time someone you think might turn into a significant other
 anybody ever been in that situation come home and meet the family all of them
 you if that's you if you're the one that's been dragged into that fresh hell
 you have come into the presence of a reference group
 Christine goodness we're so glad you're here would you like a glass of wine you would we're Baptists
 play this out a little bit let's use that image your Thanksgiving with your brand new potential. You're the one it's your family now right
 and everybody is polite pumpkin pie and so on in the course of dinner who is who here would have let's call it this some explaining to do at some point probably later or you may get dragged into the next room and you know
 if your potential significant other that you've just enjoyed dinner with these people that have been you know what am I under a microscope if that person you brought was of a different religion than you who would it have a conversation with somebody later about that
 that's called encountering the referee in the reference group right now the question is what's a different religion if you're Baptist let's imagine and the significant other is Catholic is that different enough
 maybe if your Baptist and your significant other is Jewish is that significant enough for at least a conversation who's going to have a conversation if it becomes clear that your potential significant other is an atheist who's got a problem who's going to have a conversation with somebody in the family about that snake background in you
 for whom is none of this any problem so far so good yeah they would even welcome that all right
 I want everyone in the room to imagine your name is Emily everybody imagine your name is Emily and you bring to your Thanksgiving dinner a brand new significant other name Susan
 who's family is going to say hello wait a second
 everybody in the room for 10 your name is Frank oh here we go no I'm not going to play this game anymore Frank
 your significant other is George who's having a conversation with somebody later for home in any of these but that's my point all of these sort of nominal characteristics have some consequential meaning
 to reference groups
 who's got somebody in your family that you avoid like the plague when any of this stuff comes up cuz you know you're going to get it fair enough
 a reference group the Thanksgiving table
 guy hasn't tried as a peace that refers to group size a dyad is a group of guess how many
 a Triad is a group of guess how many and then there would be tetrad and quadratic and whatever Aliana
 which of the Just the Two On the Border die in the Triad which of the two types of groups do you think is the most stable in terms of longevity instability
 a dyad who say a diet
 who is a Triad orbit right or more all right
 it turns out that the most unstable of any group is a group of two. That's not to say apple let's say or significant other which pair of significant other significant to each other that there's not a great deal of emotional connection and the till death do us part stuff really matter mean something but if you only have a group of two
 and one of them leaves or dies
 you have no group you have one person even if it's Mom Dad and Thumper if one leaves or dies you still have a group to another words a tryout or larger
 will preserve the stability of the group
 just by its numbers now this group the secondary group to which you belong has on paper 276 members judging by at least a few empty seats that I can see somebody's here
 that means maybe we just should have not bothered today if 10 of the 278 if you were here if I told you a professor second-worst questions on a test the second worst question that you can ask your professor is I missed on Thursday I wasn't here on Thursday did I miss anything
 now
 nothing important there's never anything important to hear when somebody asked me that question I usually say you know what I noticed you weren't here I called out class we couldn't manage without you
 really now come on course you miss something you miss my best act you miss my best work on that day which admittedly on some days can be pretty sorry but it was the best I had a better question is I wasn't here on Tuesday how can I make up what I missed
 how can I make another I want to know how to do what good students want to know how to do I tried to simplify this class as much as possible in a smaller class the answer to that question might be try to get some notes from somebody and former study group to be studied and it was complicated you can read about it here you can see me in the office hour Etc but the assumption is you want to know what you missed as it were rather than did I miss anything we just called it off cuz you weren't here
 I am kind of a smartass once in a while sometimes pay for that that's that go too far and back up sometimes I say something you can pick up something off the floor and wash it off but you can't wash up your words
 what was I talking about there what was the what was the larger concept that I just wandered into a digression that I lost track of
 hell yeah Triads are more stable than driving 10th and dryads
 boy he's on it today and me in general terms in general terms the larger the group The more stable it is
 the idea of monogamy and who can who can be one who can be a monogamous partner that's a preview of coming attractions in the family lecture I've got a whole piece on monogamy and the stability of dyadic relationships
 questions so far lot of terms lot of definitions and goodness we've only been at this for 40 minutes and there's only one more thing left all we got to do is sing the closing hymn holy crap closing him is 47 versus buckle up
 just settle in but are there any questions on terms Concepts definitions flashcards material to this point
 because I guarantee you a week from today they'll be questions
 seriously
 bureaucracy
 bureaucracy is a bureaucracy that's it it's going to have ups and downs it is undoubtedly the case University needs to be bureaucratized we need division of labor we need hierarchy of authority we need impersonality all that stuff so yes can it be come in person can the impersonality feel oppressive course so I would say the bureaucracies are bureaucratic they are imminently when you add them all up functional
 can they create harm to a person's identity sure
 what else yes
 like Wonder Tower Thunder yes
 I missed the word can beerocracy to be
 can I be Democratic and can they be egalitarian theoretically that's how that's how you achieved by bureaucratizing things theoretically that doesn't mean that there aren't any college Department in the at this University we have a chair maybe associate chair of senior faculty and then we have three guys that know what's what so yeah it actually designed to produce democracy
 and egalitarianism now whether they do that is open to question and in some ways that's how redress occurs wait a minute we have trampled on the Constitution or something you know
 others credit questions
 okay
 I have research I have stories and I have an assignment all dealing with the extraordinary powerful group dynamic of Conformity of conform
 what do you have to do to get somebody to go along with you and get along with your ideas how do we produce entyce worse or command for for Conformity to dead white guys brilliant social psychologist Stanley Milgram and Solomon asch had an answer
 20000 people can't be wrong Solomon asch did An Elegant little experiment that I've given you a link to a recap of on the in the YouTube video of Solomon asch not song that but someone doing this experiment because as soon as I get done with you would probably
 Solomon asch experiment was deceptively simple and I'm going to try to draw this with some level of accuracy Solomon asch
 put for Haley at a table
 and had 12 people sitting around with her
 and then he showed them to
 large cards not quite this large maybe and on these two cards were simple set of lines
 I'm card one was one line Looks something like that
 on card two or three lines
 Line 1 line 2 line 3
 and the question was pretty simple Haley are victim here
 is the only research subject in the room but she does not know that she thinks she's one of a dozen or so research subjects designed or called together to be a part of an experiment on perception that's what this is about that's not what it's about but she doesn't know that
 just considered to be a part of it she knows the risk so it's all legal
 the perception question is this which line on card to one two or three and they've got a better look at it to Icon which line on car two is the same length as well as the one in an effort to make it look like it's the middle line for Haley here says
 number one if you look at it from this angle I'm pretty sure that's what it is it's number one Hayley's gone each making the case
 that it's number one
 and finally after listening to
 20 people say it's number one what do all of the Haley's who are in these experiments would have been run hundreds of times what do they do more often than when they give their answer
 yes it must be one
 who would say in your whole life at least once
 you have gone along to get along in ways that you knew
 we're out of whack with your perception
 now here's where I'm going to go over the edge for you
 I want you to imagine that instead of
 you know what it's number one I'm sure of it I can see it from here instead of the two words
 that 20 people convince Haley about that line
 instead of those two words number one hits these two words
 fake news
 fake news everybody that's all it is
 full measure the damn line
 next time you hear fake news measure the line find out think for yourself
 is that over the edge
 I meant that in a good Christian way
 I'm more consequential experiment Stanley Milgram and this is just the one little reading for this for this lecture
 the man who Shock the World Stanley Milgram in the 60s was trying to think through and find a way to demonstrate what it takes
 to coerce an individual to do harm to another individual
 he was actually trying to explain the Holocaust in microcosm how did this work
 this bureaucracy for genocide was composed of all kinds of little micro parts
 people
 normal well-schooled
 arguably decent people did their little part in a bureaucracy for genocide
 that created the Holocaust in a laboratory
 this was a fascinating experiment
 scares the crap out of me
 he put a research subject in a chair at a table
 with a script and a set of headphones and a button
 and he told he lied through his teeth he told the subject that this is an experiment in conditioning with regard to at least in terms of this experiment reading accuracy
 we want to try to train people to read more accurately improve cognition blah blah blah
 so we got the subject in the chair
 who threw the headphones is listening to someone who he or she knows is on the other side of this wall turns out a very thin wall
 and the deal is
 they're going to read the script that you have in front of you and you going to hear the reading and into your headphones and as soon as they make a mistake they leave a word out they mispronounce a word they skip something they stumble I want you to push this red button and what's going to happen is there going to be a little shocked
 they're going to get a message from you saying that they made a mistake and that they have sports should be more careful
 turn off got the drill
 so here we go Milgram is standing over here with a clipboard and a pen take a note and the pain that's all he's got it is otherwise and a room that has no other external stimuli with a clipboard somebody and somebody back here reading
 read read read read read labs
 hits the button
 and through the thin wall
 feed carefully-designed thin wall the person here goes here's what was that
 what happened to the headphones
 keep breathing read read read read read novel apps
 one more time read read read
 at this point chair subject looks over
 the rules of the experiment dictate you must continue
 read read read condition you're going to kill
 I'm going to throw up
 silence
 crap
 Milgram wanted to know
 what percentage of the people in the chairs that he put He could get to keep pushing the button to silence just by standing there looking authoritative
 want to know the answer
 Jordan 3
 two of the three who's going to do that
 I'm not sure I'll let you speak and in here who is saying yourself I hope to heck I'd never do that but I can't guarantee I wouldn't know how does this apply to Real Life program was trying to explain the Holocaust I think he doesn't elegant job of explaining hazing
 initiation rites that cause harm to other people you would never one on one
 participate in a process that cause someone to put their life in danger by consuming excessive amounts of alcohol you would never do that one-on-one but it's an initiation Rite as it were
 it explains hazing
 it also explains
 fresh hell in Middle School
 I have a I have a book that I would recommend I have a story that's extremely hard to tell and then I have a little exercise for you this three more things in play
 oh my gosh the Stanford Prison Experiment Yasin cuz I'm Bardo look bad out let me let me get ya let me just digress on that you know the zimbardo things
 you should watch that
 I just use milligram but since you brought it up there's a stunning example in
 close to your lifetime in real life of what's in borrowed zimbardo does who's ever heard or read about Abu ghraib prison in Iraq
 and coming out of that are pictures of American military personnel doing what are arguably degrading things to prisoners For Better or Worse the most famous of which was a prisoner that was draped in a black Poncho and Hood standing on a box on one foot hooked up to electrodes
 whether this is a good idea is an open question but it violates the Geneva Convention and it made headline news in these pictures went all over the world somebody ask zimbardo what do you think about that what zimbardo did is he took college students and put them into two group prisoners and guards and said go be prisoners go be guard and within a half a day guards were these are college kids just like you randomly split
 how many cards in Bartow and so what do you think these pictures will look just like it
 it doesn't take much exactly experiments I think are on point for this to
 Jodi Picoult Picoult widely rights chick books my wife reads almost everything she writes who's who knows the author Jodi Picoult current novelist rather famous
 you should look her up and you should read at least the one book that is decidedly not a chick book it's a novel the title of the book is 19 minutes 19 minutes it came out 10-12 years ago did by chance is anybody read the book Nineteen Minutes Jodi Picoult probably pretty cheap on Kindle
 the title 19 minutes refers to the amount of time between the first and the last shot in a school shooting
 and it's a book that's written from three different points of view and they switch back and forth and the timeframe switches back and forth It's a riveting read you get into the mind of the victim's you get into the mind of those who are hiding you get into the mind of the shooter
 and the book I think there's an elegant job of delving into the emotional dynamics that at least in that instance produce those 19 minutes of hell
 and the question that a lot of people think this book answers is why are there school shootings and it has to do with bullying and Dynamics and all that kind of stuff
 I don't think of answers that question it does not I mean it doesn't part answer the question why did the school shooting happen and you can infer of that what you will here's the hoses that scares the crap out of me when I look at garden-variety high school and middle school the question the book Nineteen Minutes
 well there are increasingly since Jodi Picoult wrote that book
 and the Dynamics that isolate
 emotionally fragile people
 our way of life and public high schools
 start command that to your your your reading
 and I want to tell you a story
 it's not it's not a stunning supposed to punch line is your professor is an idiot while he was an idiot this day and he was in Middle School
 and you know it's not hard for you to imagine I don't suppose it in middle school I was kind of scrawny
 you know I don't have any biceps at all now I never have I wore thick glasses at a sarcastic sense of humor I was an athlete however gymnastics
 and you know I didn't know but from one day to the next whether it would be fresh he'll at least have a quiet day
 from the Cool Kids R Kids in homeroom I know who they were kind of wanted to be like them I had one pair of pants that were pegged tight enough to make me look cool at least try to wear those everyday
 I was not the only one that got the attention of the cool kids in a negative way but I didn't get it as much
 as the title of the story which is I remember Billy that's the title of the story I remember Billy Billy was the smart kid the rich kid the poor kid and the fat kid right and the fat kid
 it was also the dumb kid
 and even smell very good
 and Billy was the target of regular Wrath
 and which was sad because he could beat the crap out any one of the cool kids if he hadn't been emotionally beaten down to the point where you know to use his size of his strength and he was a significant size and of significant strength and not entirely stupid
 before the day I'm going to relay it to you in a minute couple months prior teacher came in a cylinder full of a greenish liquid that look a lot like Gatorade and he simply set it on the counter and said and I know what this is we walked over put his finger in the cylinder and smell what he pulled out a ghost antifreeze
 I do know that
 Russian guy sitting down goes with me and my dad work on the cars
 didn't change much but it was his little moment
 anyway
 at one point one day Billy was an easy target. Yummy
 Hayden smelly smell worse than usual and said something stupid and it was relentless and that's the day that I decided to play along they weren't picking on me Billy's easy and I have a wicked sense of humor I can use it you know what I think that humor is the is the backside of anger and it's an effective way of channeling anger by the way I was mad because I was scrawny and picked on and so I just made fun like everybody else
 look at this big fat kid to start crying
 mission accomplished
 and I will tell you truthfully that I cannot remember the first and last name of anybody else in that only but I remember Billy
 and
 I remember thinking that shouldn't have been so easy you know what somebody should have defended him and I was in a position to do that but it was certainly position not to play along
 I know you know middle school kids are just clueless by definition
 but I think it's useful for us to ponder
 what we learned and when we learned it and I learned a harsh lesson that they by looking in the mirror and saying what were you thinking you obviously weren't and it's not. That's not the last time I've ever done anything
 you know when Alex Lee heinous to other people and we all make mistakes and and then you know you started wearing incrementally point in my life and I remember him vividly and I remember his last name and
 and I don't remember anybody else to that level of of a Precision in that Home Room
 and and that's the end of the lecture portion but we still have to nod to the governor today to before you take out any paper I want you to be very clear about what I want to ask you to do
 I want to ask you in a tweet 280 characters or less or fish to three sentences
 tell a story
 about somebody you remember in the same way I remember Billy now you don't have to be
 the go along or person in doing something heinous to somebody but who do you remember in light of Stanley Milgram in light of Solomon asch in light I remember Billy name day I remember selling so I will not see you for a while so I wish you well and you can bring down the I remember such-and-such at your convenience thank you
