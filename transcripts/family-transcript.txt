 good morning
  this looks like the remnants after the bloodletting on on Tuesday welcome back just normal class today Noel a shot today no pain it's all right you know we live on one of these Playa Lakes you're in town and there a lot of ducks in front you know I'd never fly upside down they never fly upside could it or fly upside down because then they quack up
  that's my favorite dad jokes I lay that on you
  we start today what will a bunch of two very similar segments in the class this is a 3 presentation segment which means the next test comes up pretty fast it comes up to two weeks from today we have a lecture today so we have a presentation today Tuesday and Thursday next week and then the following Tuesday so a week from Tuesday is test for these next two segments and Compass six presentations of what we have called to this point in the clasp social institutions family religion education Healthcare politics economy this segment segment 4 covers the value based social institutions either the places in society where we
  develop and hold and call into question and maybe even change some of the things that we believe our values from family from church from school more or less
  segment 5 involves three other the other three Healthcare politics and economics and these are the sort of interest-based social institutions and values and interests are the two motivating factors for pretty much everything we do anything we decide to do we do with one because it's either the right thing to do or we believe in it or we get some kind of emotional pull or push toward or away from
  in other words it serves our sense of what's right and necessary
  they're also interest-based social institutions we get our needs map do we stand to gain or lose as a result of of what we have what we do so all decisions are based on values and interests and values primarily come from family religion and education and interests are primarily served through Healthcare politics and economy so that's the logic of the next two segments or six presentations at this point are there any questions about content Logistics details most of you have had midterm grades posted I should tell you that I tend to be pretty conservative with those I don't include any Abbott points and if you're like one point away from a b r a c i generally I generally give the lower grade at the midterm and that's to motivate you are nuts okay if you don't understand your midterm grade that's that's that's how I do it I don't give pluses minuses or anyting else
  choice questions
  everybody's leaning forward like there's truth and entertainment about to be imparted and I just can't wait
  anybody from Houston
  kind of hoping it's going to snow
  I have no idea where that came from I you know I have a v a plane flight tomorrow morning at 5 I hope it doesn't snow then
  I could just sit here and rip a digression for an hour and a half if you'd rather post up last semester's lecture on fan. Let's not do that your family and by that we mean sort of the functionalist nucleus of society Mom Dad Junior Sisk Mom and Dad married to each other you know 1950s sitcom family got it already come from some form of Step family kind of got a new you know kind of a new thing
  extended family got an add-on uncle or grandparent or somebody else living with you so they extended family
  my grandma lives with me and my family when I was like 12 or 13 and she was she was the source of light in my life you know when your 12 or 13 you do stuff that is pretty heinous and I did heinous things as a tween and my grandma love me anyway that's that's that's the cool part but when is there are lots of different types of what it means to be a family and let me give you the technical definition the textbook definition with one little edition of my own that I think really hits the breadth of what family is a family is a number of people
  who are related to one another just a number of people are related to one another now we're going to talk about how that is a number of people are related to one another by blood or the biological Connection by Blood marriage which is a legal finding family document adoption same thing
  so far the number people related to one another by Blood marriage or adoption
  and here's my Edition or agreement
  can I give blood to marriage adoption agreement and
  who share social life or who share social responsibility
  the agreement part is intriguing we can it's like the Scott Thelma article on the gave Angelica we can call ourselves gain Evangelical because that's who we know it to be
  the typical agreement type of family would be a cohabiting couple and as it turns out cohabiting couples also now since
  late 1970s
  have some recourse for property and child rights if there's a dissolution of that dissolution that cohabiting relationships are some of the rules and supports that apply to marriage also apply to cohabiting couples and I'm going to do it at the end of this segment I'm going to do another piece on an agreed-upon relationship and talk about that in some detail yeah yeah right by Blood related by blood marriage adoption agreement who share social life and social responsibility fair enough
  so you know you can be family with those who agree to have you in their life in a variety of ways we talk about what families do in a successful this concept of the institutional family as it reproduces social stability these are the functions of the family
  red reproduction obviously
  not the only I mean you can reproduce with anybody but the family
  it did when you have an offspring
  you are legally connected to that person even if
  if it's the result of a one-night stand and someone you never see again you know you still are the biological parent of that child and that will be registered in that child's identity will be connected to you that's how deeply embedded this notion of reproduction and identity is in a functional to side protection I told you about the ducks on my like it takes a little yellow fuzzy duck about seven weeks to become independent that's not very long and that's an evolutionary benefit because ducks a special little fuzzy ones are vulnerable to dogs and cats and hate us teenagers are twins that just decide ho let's take that that's use it for a golf ball now let's not take longer to grow up don't we
  maybe you got an Uncle Frank it's hasn't grown up yet he's in his 50s right it is legally required that families parents protect their children that's why we have laws Against Child Abuse and so on and we have even institutionalized agencies like Child Protective Services to both assist and surveil and adjudicate and redress and and provide resources for parents who struggle to protect their children as it were so protection is embedded in the culture socialization
  basically we learn
  gender roles in our families and we also learn
  folkways
  courtesy proper behavior decency were socialized to be civil and social with your whole lecture on that early in the term and we also primarily learn gender roles and again we also if you know
  we sort of become who we are because of those to whom we are born and I'll get that in a minute so reproduction preserves health and safety socialization provides us
  with what we need to learn to go along and get along in a society that also Institute also in beds in US gender roles not necessarily conventional gender roles
  regulation of sexual behavior got a short little digression roof here to illustrate how complicated this is how complicated this if it's the one thing that I think about you talked about last week it is deeply connected to our identity we are sexual beings because that's how we reproduce but it also generates a level of connection emotionally and intimately with other people the question is with who when and how do we learn all about that not just the mechanics but the social connection to it ideally mom and dad all right
  who remembers the day you were minding your own beeswax and one or the other of your parents said give me a second we have to have a little talk and no no not that
  or something to that effect
  how many do you never had that happen you never had that now go figure it out right here read this book and if you have questions let me know what he's doing right
  it's not something that we typically learn about in the same way we learn about other more or I should say less emotionally by Little Things
  teach me how to sew teach me how to use a hammer teach me how to tune the car teach me about sex
  we should have given that over to the school's right
  and at least in the South lucky for you the curriculum for sex ed in schools is like one sentence they don't have to use much paper you have to buy textbook don't until you're married then
  be fruitful and multiply it somewhat who would agree that the whole question the whole issue is somewhat more complicated than that in real life would you say that course it is and that we buy and large handle it badly
  we live in the Bible Belt South and the length of the sex-ed curriculum in schools is largely determined by how close a state or a city as to the Buckle of the Bible Belt
  just don't which is we know already that by the time high school kids AR-15 they don't has left the building and that's a very hard Bell to unwrinkle don't what I was I was kind of planning as soon as possible because it's very hard to unring that and Chrissy argument is if you put a condom machine and up boys bathroom and high school the boys will think about sex
  here's my rejoinder to that if you give a high school student a number 2 pencil they will think about sex that's what they think about end of story
  and it would seem to me that the people who love us would want us to learn more about being safe as much as being good stewards of this extraordinary powerful socio-emotional physical reality
  you're not going to like this question so just to Steel yourself trigger trigger alert about you how many of you know whether or not the answer this question is yes or no and I don't want to know what the answer is I just want to know do you know the answer to this question
  mom and dad
  got busy before they were married who knows whether or not that's true
  who just went babies come from flowers mom and dad never did that and they still don't ever
  I want to leave too many Vivid mine pictures in your head but the more important question is this if you know
  based on what you know
  does that inform your own thinking who would say so
  we are leading by example
  and I think my my deal is the flying this is that the way we do this whether it comes through haphazardly and families or whether families turn this over to schools
  is that it puts people we love at risk for disease for unplanned pregnancy the Bible Belt South leads the country in STDs and unplanned pregnancies and that those are life-changing in some ways life wrecking sometimes life enhancing realities
  now okay mr. smart guy PhD sociology Minister type what would you do all right glad you asked I will tell you
  let me just ask this how many of you have a younger sibling who you imagine is sort of struggling with the same stuff you struggled with and are you worried about him a little bit about this problem and of course you know you want to take them aside and talk no
  well if you ever do here's what I would tell you I would tell anyone who especially if they're
  14 15 16 and we know that's where the average age of quote on quote on set is for this what would I tell them I would tell them that I would say I don't tell you what to do I'm going to tell you what it means
  the people you have sex with live in your head your entire life
  especially the first one
  now you have to ask yourself a question
  who do you want in your house up here and then make your decision based on the most people do not have maybe less than 5 for most and I know you may know somebody that's got 10 or 15 already but that's not typical it's also not healthy it's also not edifying in my opinion emotionally and if you're going to make this decision here is how you can at least reduce the odds of getting sick or pregnant or getting somebody pregnant as it were that's what I would say and you make your own decision but you need to know that this is a bill that cannot be on run and whoever you're with will live in your head rent-free your entire life
  that's what I would say
  end of digression with the stuff that's going to be on the test I know all right
  affection and companionship illustrate this with a sermon title like I read one time that's a nod illustration
  I went to a church on my Sunday off many many years ago which didn't happen very often but I walked in my wife and I went to church and it will open up the church bulletin to see the title of the sermon
  the church is our home that was a title of the sermon I'm going we're going to need an insulin shot by the time we get out of this right
  what are the best sermons I ever heard
  the two major points of the sermon water were one
  home is where when you go there they have to take you in
  not even not original to the minister that's a quote from Robert Frost home is where they have to take you and I kind of do right giving you expect to have to pay rent know that your room will be rented out to somebody else probably not
  nevermind home is where they have to take you in and and I thought this was even more important tell me if I'm right about this just by your attention and nodding home is where you go to be your nastiest
  the people you love have experienced some heinous things from you have they not
  and the people who know your secrets and love you anyway bear family
  I thought that was an awesome sermon home is where you go
  where they have to take you in and where you go to be your nastiest then you know my pal doctor Bocce talked about the church and both of those terms in summer
  we expect to be
  comforted and protected and hugged if you will with the people that we call family because that's an emotional need we all need companionship we all need to know
  who the people are in our lives that know the private stuff and who love us anyway that's important then finally there's a social status component you are tied to other people particularly usually dad by your last name who has a last name that in your town was reasonably recognizable by other people
  you know the town
  Council of the local physician administer that kind of thing
  can I have I done The Minister's kid riff in this class yet okay is that fun
  now I'm not going to ask you personally but I'm going to ask you if you know you can resonate with this with everybody who knows The Minister's kid
  guy who would say that The Minister's kids you know
  when they are
  at where they usually are at let's say 10 on a Sunday morning that's generally the Sunday School hour right ministers kids at 10 a.m. on Sunday
  that's a different kid than the kid you know sometimes elsewhere
  why you going this rupali yeah that boy oh boy if they only knew wouldn't that be fun and whoever ratted out a Minister's kid just to be mean
  yeah I kind of call the hypocrisy Factor right you know
  you live with who you were born to
  we used to say and when I was in alcoholism treatment counselor we used to talk to people who were grievously guilty about the wreckage their own behavior caused with people they loved and you said I have to get over that and one of the ways you get over it is when somebody says to you you did a pretty poor job of picking your parents didn't you cuz of the genetic Factor they went with genetic soup and social connection to people with rather famous or inFAMOUS last names locally or maybe even tell me if your last name is gasey in this country is anybody remember John Wayne Gacy
  I don't know the story one of the most infamous serial killers
  killer clown yeah I actually knew him I visited my death row in Illinois 30 years ago but with the last name that mr. Hitler
  thanks for that my point is
  the family name can be a lot of things and it's Elizabeth's just in the story there questions
  regulation of sexual behavior is that something that we give over to the family and largely do badly it is a functional these are all the things that a functionally a functional Society a stable Society will rely on the institution of the family to produce
  what else
  A1 sound bite on each of those don't know let me see
  reproduction birth certificate
  protection
  feeling safe at home and we have the state to help us with that socialization be civil and social regulation of sexual behavior complicated affection and companionship
  unconditional love
  and social status your last name I'm just making this up does that make sense does that cuz that cover it the help
  Catholic response to this is sort of
  it was actually pretty precise and not very complicated
  a conflict
  critique or rejoinder to all of that I just said all of this sort of
  functional soup over here a conflict response would say
  that that does two things that keeps resources generally where they already are
  because we're taught to be compliant
  it also rather rigidly reproduces gender roles
  that we learn
  the masculine feminine component of our biology in families and that can lead to the reproduction of inequality for a response all that functional family stuff reproduces inequality and by and large reproduces gender inequality it's not a lot more complicated than that and we've done so much on gender inequality in the previous segment that I don't want to revisit that particularly unless you have questions
  okay
  let's talk about the family in terms of one family these are predictable benchmarks in the life of Sam it's the details that emerge when these benchmarks hit
  are varied their unique one to every family but these are sort of predictable things how many of you know the story of when your mom and dad met they want to know for how many of you would say it was just so cool and sweet
  for how many would you report that that first meeting went badly
  and you're lucky you're here
  now you're lucky you're here for whatever reasons but anyway
  courtship it's kind of an archaic term we go courting and if you're in Victorian England there are very strict rules for how you do that if you're in colonial America very strict rules for how you go about seeking out someone who might become significant okay it's 21st century America the courtship process starts where before you answer let me talk about 1/2 let's imagine you wake up one morning if you're in a relationship at the moment pretend you're not they just pretend
  you wake up one morning and you say to yourself
  This Is The Day
  I am available I am seeking
  a significant relationship I'm a-goin A-Courtin right
  I'm in the market to be marketable now the question is what do you do next where do you go what do you do
  who says what
  where do you go when you do
  Heather I guess that kind of depends on how you want your life to go
  the bar the bar I think that's probably a good idea bars are places where there's generally good music maybe tasty food people having a good time dancing and if you're of age course and words of a somewhat famous comedian I look
  doesn't work no seriously people's inhibition so down a little bit it's really hard to strike up a conversation with a stranger especially someone you've you sort of go interesting Toyota bar where else might you go obviously the dating sites on the internet and that has changed our courtship life immeasurably but if you're going to really take your real body to a real place of ours one place where else might you go
  party sure sort of like a private bar is it where picture party where the people are going any other ideas
  the gym the gym sure people who are like another word for so far we've talked about three places where you're going to meet people you might be like minded with right
  go to college right who know this is why this is not quite November so we had September October and to two and a half months or so how many do you know somebody that is now in what is a seriously developing potentially significant relationship now with someone that had not met three months ago that's the idea you know who it's a church
  again like-minded people
  well once you have decided this is you you have taken you somewhere
  what's your next move in real time and in real life when you catch sight of someone you'd like to learn a little bit more about what's your next move
  what happens next
  but I'm not how you start the meeting
  who would say the eyes have it
  yeah I mean
  you said we have writer's block
  your existence probably started with eye contact
  it moved this move to other kind of contact
  that's probably where it starts and then you people who are very glue and conversation that my point here is this is somewhat haphazard to is it not
  what you get
  a phone number
  you get a yes when you say
  how about we do this again
  okay okay okay
  Etc courtship
  wow I don't ever do that again don't course at some point and you hope that you arrived at this point with the person you have now evolved into a significant relationship with at some point you agree that there will be no extracurricular eye contact get what I mean
  ideally you both come to that conclusion at the same time and agree that that's the what you want anybody know anybody that's gotten into trouble because they didn't know that was the rule yet
  yeah
  and at some point you step forward and say I do
  and again from a functionalist point of view marriage solidifies this it makes it once you step forward and say I do it's a lot harder to step back and say I don't want anymore
  calling couples it's somewhat easier although not without some legal complications
  marriage we are now to who has become I know the Bible says one but the Bible is wrong what did you just say that
  I think I think you know conceptually to become three
  2 who are married create a new being called us a couple
  you have three of you in this partnership you who you are you have who he or she is and you have who you are together that person that being is called us
  and stepping out of this role and being your premarital counselor when resources are short and they always are in new relationships when resources are short
  feed us first fetus first
  just a friendly little advice from you. Jungle Jerry
  12 marriage and generally this is really up high water mark in most people's lives you know it's a moment they never forget it isn't necessarily the only time they have a moment like which we'll get to in a little bit
  but you evolve into a mustard being is kind of your identity now
  and then you know you and me and baby makes three right well Thumper comes along in the best of all worlds in this was you you know who's the firstborn oh my gosh did you change things and this is true for any child born to any couple
  everything your parents did after you were born
  was filtered through your neat every decision they made it up to and including when do I go to sleep
  I guess I don't
  because Etc
  that is an interesting dynamic
  what I'm about to tell you is research that somewhat contrived because it's almost impossible to separate this out but sociologists answers to difficult questions so we have done surveys where we have asked married couples with a brand-new first child
  how's your life what we measure life satisfaction in lots of different ways how's your life great big time spike in life satisfaction generally when you have a child and then we ask the dirty question before Harry Potter veritaserum into people's mouths and we say how's your marriage
  marital satisfaction as distinct from Life satisfaction a little dip why because when there was just two of you you did not have to compete for each other's attention you could give each other undivided attention not so anymore and that's one of the things you have to work out what it means to be married to each other when you also have a child and that is complicated
  it's again it's contrived because you really can't separate out one part of what's satisfying or not in your life in any really meaningful way except when people like us to think about it and you have to tell the truth yeah you know the marriage is fine but you know we don't have a lot of the things that we used to have with regard to Serendipity or autonomy or freedom to just say you know what there's a flight to Paris at 6 let's get on it you know probably not without some thought as it were
  and of course raising a child is the focus of what your parents did for at least the first five the absolute focus of what your parents did for at least 5 or 6 years of your life then they handed you off to the schools and you became partners
  and then you left oh no
  first ones again hands up
  do you remember what your parents said or look like when you said goodbye at Texas Tech that was not easy was it especially if you're the first born
  who's the last one out same moment and you've been partying at Texas Tech they hit the gas and get a face full of exhaust like we're free
  that's a passage you know it really is especially the last one out and the dog dies
  this is a big dick
  and now suddenly they haven't been you and me since the bar almost spike in the divorce rate at midlife because of what the Dynamics that I just talked about. Certainly is generally happens when all of you leave in the dog dies metaphor it
  they look at each other and they go oh I remember you
  remember that yeah wow who's got parents that are just starting to act too cute again with each other just a little bit God love them it's been awhile
  and then there are others for home
  I don't know what we had then we don't have it now and then you can work at regathering recapturing but there's a little spike in the split up rate at midlife and that's just for the telling Benchmark on what it means to evolve through you only get one life you know
  and then you confront later life and their parts of later life I'm speaking here as one who's in it that are out there just awesome generally you know you pay off the mortgage eventually you generally have a little more money generally have a little more Savvy you had some experiences we've learned some hard lessons that you don't have to reboot and you know if you got somebody with you that still loves you anyway and you know that there's a lot good grandchildren especially you know that's an edifying thing cuz if you can actually send them home
  grandkids come over you play with them you break them you give them all kinds of sugar if buy them anything they want and then send them home to stay up all night it's awesome but also know that the clock is running and it feels like the clock is running faster you know
  I've talked to and you know
  being older forces you to confront some things that are not our kind of frightening actually
  month or so ago that meant a lot to me you know because you start dealing with matters related to health and you start looking at finitude and stuff like that and Charlie Brown Snoopy
  you only live once Charlie Brown
  her she'll be you only live once Snoopy and Snoopy says no you only die once
  you live everyday
  and I thought that mean that hit me just Between the Eyes especially as I'm about to apply for Social Security and you don't need to have that mean something important to you until you're my age you only live once no you only die once you live everyday and you live with what you've got every day
  couple of quick sound bites on this stuff
  there is an increasing dramatically increasing percentage of the 20 to 30 age population that are in significant relationships that are not marriages
  what's interesting is those cohabitation Arrangements start at about the same time marriages started 40 years ago people got married right around the age of funeral if you look at it without your glasses and it's sort of fuzzy right around the age of 21
  and now 40 years later or so marriage ages 25 26 you know on average a little bit higher for men than for women men tend to marry women who are younger than they are a little bit sometimes a lot but the marriage age is roughly the same as the marriage age two generations ago so we are coupling up at roughly the same time as other words this stage of life where you go from being a single person to a significant person to someone else is roughly the same and you know there are lots of reasons for this I'll talk about divorce and remarriage in a second
  but like the the key variable in what generates a successful cohabitation is the level of commitment what does this mean
  we have formalized we've even scripted
  the words of commitment for a wet for a marriage and you can you know you've got the memories do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer than Etc you can say what those words mean other ways as in
  I want the key to the house
  or can I have the key to the house
  soar like will you marry me
  Etc and if that level of commitment it's the way you say that means to the two of you the same as for better or worse for richer for poorer you've got a relationship that tends to be equally happy but people can have it for other reasons that are less
  less rigid or less every once in a while I am at a loss for words that are less under that are less formally understood there is no mistake what a woman and a man or a man a man or a woman and a woman say to each other when they're eyeball-to-eyeball in front of the minister and God and everybody else there's no mistake about what that means and if there's no mistake about what it means to move in together or go have it if you will then you've essentially got a marriage that functions in the same way
  let's talk about divorce and remarriage it's quite common comparatively that 1/3 to half of first marriages and in a dissolution of marriage that's what the legal term is for a divorce the dissolution of marriage
  here's a trivia question I want you to imagine we've got 10,000 couples in this half of the room that are currently in their first marriage during their first marriage both of them to each other
  and over here we got another 10,000 couples who are married to each other and one or both of them is in a second or subsequent marriage a second or subsequent marriage
  now let's look at both of those categories are piles of people in 10 years in which group is the divorce rate higher in other words the percentage of first marriages that end versus the percentage of second or subsequent marriages that end who is a first marriage is higher second or subsequent that's what we find
  why is this
  come little digression come in here
  there are lots of reasons
  American culture has been critiqued for making divorce too easy we now have but this is only been true for the last 20 or so years every state has what are called no fault divorce laws that means that a couple who wish to be not married can file the paperwork and go before a judge and say together we have irreconcilable differences we have we wish not to be married and those that wish has is is irreconcilable and if the property is equitably divided in the children are well custodial wised in an agreeable way it takes a lot less than it used to
  in 1950 if a marriage if a couple wish if one or the other of a couple wished not to be married and approve fault that the go before a judge and say he did this or she did that and here's the evidence for it so I'm like criminal trial and there were limited numbers of categories of things you've had to prove adultery abandonment physical cruelty mental cruelty what store did the catch-all and that was what generate but you had to look somebody in the eye and say to a judge this is what he did or this is what she did in that was contentious and the thought of doing that with someone who beat you regularly
  was daunting and that's largely the result that's largely the Genesis with no fault divorce laws
  maybe you know people who you asked why are you staying at relationship you know and the reason is when you start to end abusive relationship that's the time you're most likely to be killed
  and no fault divorce laws save lives by not having to prove this that or the other thing are there more divorces of second or subsequent
  Einstein said a lot of brilliant things others when having nothing to do with science he said that if you do the same thing over and over and expect the outcome to be different insanity
  to make a second or subsequent marriage work and this should happen in first marriages but it doesn't always
  it requires a sort of Ridgid examination of who you are and what you need let me ask this let's go back to middle school or high school who was in what you would call a significant relationship in middle school or high school that you are no longer again who would say that
  who got dumped
  yeah remember that day
  Dutch Uncle Jerry here getting dumped is good for you one most of us would not do well with the people we were in love with his high school sophomore is it just generally doesn't play out
  I in ways that are helpful but more than that more than that
  getting dumped or being the dumper
  requires you to really get inside what you need and know what you have to give and you know I'm I'm in a second marriage now and I took a long time
  to go from one to the other there's a 10-year more than that about a 12 year Gap and
  that required me to do a lot of soul-searching the reason that first marriage didn't work out as it never should have started we were deer just dreadfully mismatch people and both of us had other reasons for wanting to be married just generally and we married each other cuz it was handy at the time
  and so if you don't do that if you just say well let's try this again without really taking a hard look at what you need and who needs you to be that for them
  it's like doing the same thing over and over and expecting the outcome to be different and that's insane I have a friend I think a lot of him he's currently in his sixth marriage 6th
  and I remember his fourth marriage just was 15-20 years ago I was there and his brother-in-law did what is I think one of the most heinous pranks I've ever seen pulled on someone bumper stickers and at the fourth wedding of the guy that is now in his sixth one
  he put bumper stickers and everybody's carnett's at Hawk if you've ever been married to and had the guys name
  it's a riff on a Lewis Grizzard joke you know but bless his heart he just keeps
  looking for the same kind of person with whom he is woefully mismatched and he doesn't know it cuz it's hard for him to look at himself and that's the tough part
  you need to be brutally honest with yourself about what you have to give and what you really need from someone else you know what I mean I need things from other from significant finding things from my wife that not everybody would be willing to give me and I'm lucky that I found someone who wants but that's the point so that's part of why that's the main reason why second and subsequent marriages don't work out as we keep doing the same thing and expect the outcome to be different why do we do that cuz it's hard not to
  it's really hard to confront what you need to confront to move forward and make it work if it hasn't worked
  Family Violence is a
  it's a brutal violation of sacred trust home is where you go to be your nastiest home is not where you go to have someone be there nastiest on you and hit you and hurt you and control you and steal your money or prevent etc etc etc
  men and women actually do hit each other
  there's a rather controversial Theory called gender symmetry of violence and that is research that suggests that the physical
  confrontation and physically the physical contact hitting each other to keep looking for words today that happened with relatively equal frequency
  and you know feminists react to that and go wait a second wait a second that may be true it may be arguably true and the data on this are mixed that is not a definitive research agenda there is some evidence that suggests in some ways and under some circumstances that's true but even when that's true
  the fight usually ends with the bigger one ending it
  either definitively with someone being unconscious hospitalized running away or dead
  the guy usually answered
  so what does that tell us it tells us that the things can get out of hand other than fish definitely an alcohol component to Family Violence you know we look at the types of things we ingest to change how we feel or see the world and most of them are not associated with violence that mean there's a lot of we're seeing now with the legalization of marijuana and certainly with the issue of vaping we're seeing a lot of dangerous things associated with that that we didn't know before
  we are still not seeing however the level of violence that is precipitated by overconsumption of alcohol my brother-in-law's a retired homicide detective and they're they're the way they described just alcohol is liquid stupidity you know and some guys and girls know this
  Famous Last Words literally but
  the larger argument here gender symmetry of violence is one point the other is
  and this has I think Global implications this is very micro thing that has Global implications
  the one thing that is most likely to happen following a violent Act
  whether or not that violent Act is a cussing out verbal humiliation
  striking someone with a fist hitting someone with a stick shooting them dead
  we're going to war with them you know I mean country the country the most likely another violent Act
  the violence produces violence as a matter of principle your parents held this value have never once been spanked for anything you've done as it has a matter of principle we will handle this another way right for how many I think that's not an uncommonly held value
  I didn't do it well that's for something you got away with you know ready shooting that's a strategy
  anybody go to the high school where it was
  technically possible for a principal to smack you wow that's a very complicated question there's usually a lot of paperwork to be filled out etc etc
  but there's a research agenda that says
  that corporal punishment
  is in part connected to a propensity for later life violence when you learn that on the list of strategies to solve a problem includes hitting someone
  when that strategy stays on the list there's a higher percentage of
  a Family Violence of the spousal violence or child abuse especially if you have a very strong but a noticeable Association and in some ways the way you measure the research of the way the research has been done and arguably causal connection between corporal punishment and Family Violence and that's why you know some couples have to come to the decision we will solve this another way once you put violence on the list of ways to solve trouble in the house
  it tends to stay there
  questions so far
  got to get my script
  some time ago when we were talking about dyads and Triads I made the point that a dyad a group of two is an inherently unstable relationship that's it no group that one of the ways that a functional Society has evolved to
  stabilized and unstable relationships we've invented marriage. Marriage has been invented forever marriage which which evolves from free choice based on romance love and intimacy is relatively new couple hundred years arranged marriage is much more common
  but the point is we have established a legal
  process that gives a couple a level of solidarity with their world and also sort of internal stability it's just harder in a relationship is also ratified by the people that's what that's what I'm trying to say other people look at them and say oh you're married to each other how wonderful
  so the question becomes since we know that
  why or should we or why should we not extend that inarguably beneficial social Dynamic to two men or two women who want exactly the same thing they want to live with each other love and support honor cherish in sickness and in health for better for worse
  what what's up with that well it's a lot of things up with that arguably I started giving this presentation 2005 I've got those date on my script here and I've changed it much since then and at that time I said not just to my classes
  that I'm one of the people the individuals that are in the marriage business I performer preside at weddings I really like to do that
  in 2005 being an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church we had gone through Trent the damnation cut through a process where to do so even if it was just a commitment ceremony ordination credentials at risk that if we were to present another word that was no in 2005 there was no legal way Fortuna to women to get married there was no way to get a marriage license okay ending what they called commitment ceremonies to in effect say to each other what married couples say because we already know that commitment really really helps
  but we were all told I got a document to this effect that if you do this and it looks enough like a wedding which is sort of subjective you know you could have your ordination credentials at least put on trial
  and that's when I stopped going to Presbyterian meetings because it just flat-out took me off I thought to myself
  you want to throw somebody out of this ministry in the love business for standing in front of two people who publicly declare their love for each other and then we pray about it you want to throw me out for that fine and I stood up at a Presbytery meeting and said if anybody ever asked it would be my honor
  Keppra side of the same-sex commitment ceremony
  and actually when I retired a year ago at a Presbytery meeting the person who gave my retirement speech noted that I had done that since then and we have now been instructed is Presbyterian ministers that if it's legal you're allowed to do it does not have to let you in their building if that's not what they want but I have always regarded
  the question will you preside at our wedding to be an honor and because I already know from a functionalist point of view is a sociologist that this is not just good for them it's good for all of us
  I made that decision a long time ago no sad look at no one's ever asked that's not true someone did ask actually about a year ago and it so happened that they wanted to be married on this same weekend where I was away at this dumb conference so I had dr. Bachi to the wedding and he thought it was wonderful couple win
  anyway so I've had that opportunity I but I wouldn't end and here's why
  first of all because I know functionalist sociology and a functionalist if you held them down and put Veritas serum in there would at least have to acknowledge the logic of the argument whether or not they agree with it
  I think also take this one more step I think had this been true had what is now the law of the land by Supreme Court to create an over the dead bodies of a lot of Southern politicians
  if this has been the law of the land in 1981 HIV first showed up in the US or so we would have saved lives why
  your doctor Behati say I was part of the culture that drank as much as we could and drugged as much as we could have had as much sex as we could
  why a lot of reasons but one reason that they didn't have to rely on was the marriage option get the idea
  I think had that been true we certainly would not have had no HIV but we would have had fewer
  and I would call it a win if we have had just 10 fewer
  and it would have been a lot more than that
  for people who love each other and want what married couples today what you perhaps one at some point in your life someone who will love you and cherish you and deal with you in sickness and in health and that will happen
  that's all I want
  and that's why I made that decision is why I stand by it now it's now there's no consequence so it isn't near as much fun to tell the story
  of what I would do I mean I would do what any you know but I would do what a lot of people would do without him thinking about it cuz we're in the marriage business at this point there's believe me I know that some of you are at least metaphorically coin
  what
  are you crazy that's not what God Said while it's an arguable Point let's talk about the text and I did not know that at the time that text was written in those laws were put into the litical code that their understanding of biology was what it was that the woman was just a vector carrier she contributed nothing to the biology of the child and thus sexual contact between two men was a violation fact that it was it was fatal to life I didn't know that aside
  there's a lot of things in Leviticus that you're not supposed to do and here's the problem with that verse in my opinion homosexuality is an Abomination unto the Lord the problem with it is that you know you're going to Denny's and there's this thing the kids loved A Little Crane thing with a lift out a toy and bring it over here and drop it that's kind of what we're doing with that Textra lifting it up and dropping it on the 21st century America when it did it go code the Jewish Torah they had no notion of the extent to which two men or two women might want to just live like a married couple and be committed to one another and do so in a loving gentle edifying way that's not that was unknown culturally or at least it was not talked about at all
  now
  that's much different now so then the point is on the list of things I shall not do in the levitical code I need to read these to your cuz they're pretty interesting
  if you want to drop stuff on 21st century America you can't cherry-pick your Abominations
  I don't think
  eating shellfish is an Abomination unto the Lord I love going to the coast I like oysters I like shrimp
  lobsters on K2
  these are that was a restriction that had to do with separating out culture and also Food hygiene
  selling one's daughter into slavery seemed a common occurrence
  happy with that one girls
  working on the Sabbath punishable by death who's got a job forces you to work on Sunday
  how do you work for Chick-fil-A I think that's kind of an interesting thing they aren't open on Sundays neither is Hobby Lobby
  rebellious sons who are gluttons and drunks are to be killed if you really want to know the chapter and verse I've got these
  rebellious sons who are gluttons and drunks are to be killed
  you probably got to keep that out of the mission statement of interpret ternatea console
  here is the ones I find especially compelling if you want to just sort of lift
  text out of the Torah this is these are from Deuteronomy they appear 5vs apart if they are raped Do Not Cry for Help much less stand on a witness stand
  how to be chill that's in the Bible
  although a man who rapes a virgin and stays in her head for the rest of her life and that moment is Unforgettable
  and settle this with her father for cash he can buy his way out of that violence it's in the Bible so I don't think
  obviously that's the Old Testament and a lot of good Christians say you know what let's talk about the New Testament okay let's talk about that
  maybe the Council of Nicea dropped a parchment on the floor where Jesus talks about this but he never does in the book that we have not a word about homosexuality Jesus never mention what we do know is that Jesus was notoriously soft on sexual Sinners I want my one of my favorite Story and there's some argument over whether this is actually a Biblical thing or not or whether it's something the author of the fourth gospel put in there to make a point the woman caught in adultery I love that story in John chapter 7 something really
  group of God fearing
  Church owning Orthodox Jews drag this poor woman out of her house where they caught her in the act of adultery oh my gosh caught you in the ass
  Roeser at Jesus feet and said we caught them and we get to kill her what do you think and Jesus doesn't do anything he just keeps writing in the sand
  and I keep pushing them come on come on come empty stands up and he says and this is one of most famous lines in the New Testament to memory wouldn't be your worst choice
  he says let those who among you are without sin cast the first stone
  and then walk away course
  that's the mindset which you might imagine if you were to ask the question what would Jesus do to someone like that now there are three verses in the New Testament 1st Corinthians 6 1st Timothy 1 and Romans one that is where the Apostle Paul and one of his successor mentions this the first two are clearly understood to be prohibiting behavior that is what we sometimes see in the aftermath of war or ethnic cleansing where male rape on males is designed to control humiliate and also in prison same thing
  there is a verse in Romans that people will sometimes narrow this discussion down to and I'll read it to you
  Romans 1 2627 for this reason God gave them up to degrading passions their women exchanged natural and of course for the unnatural in the same way also the men giving up natural intercourse with women were consumed with passion for one another
  Isaac and much many scholars agree
  that that has everything to do with idolatry anything that becomes the one thing in your life that's more important than anything else other than God and God's expectations for how you relate to other people is idolatry
  that's what that's about
  at the very least
  it does not refer to two people who wish to be nothing else than each other's loving partner committed and creating us to be left alone fair enough
  so that's my take on the but then again there are lots of other takes on it and you are welcomed affect I expect a lot of you to disagree and I would love any comment on that personally an email any other way
  I want to close this off by telling you another sermon title
  and I actually wrote this one I wrote this sermon title it's one of three or four sermons that I remember well enough that I could pretty much give it on the spot not going to take about two
  teleservices called lunch with Jesus lunch with Jesus and I invited all of my good Christian parishioners to imagine what it might be like
  to go want to get want to get a sandwich sure let's go and in that 30 minutes I asked them to imagine that this was like the Aladdin in the lamp story that Jesus who is all-powerful and you just come out of introductory sociology where you learned all kinds of social problems
  that just because you ask without protecting it without arguing with you but just because you ask Jesus would bam fix one thing that's wrong in the life as you see it
  pretty cool when they
  I invite you to wonder about yourselves perhaps and I'm not asking for a show of hands who would you really put same-sex marriage as the one and only thing you'd like to use it to fix if you could get into absolutely fixed one and only thing
  I haven't taken a look at
  refugees
  at least before that so it's really up to you I am very grateful for your attention and any thoughts you give to this or any other matter and would welcome any other comments thank you very much
