good morning everybody
 first things first
 what is the mummy's favorite kind of music the music most favored by mummies
 rap
 hey Dad
 okay couple of quick announcements I mentioned on Tuesday that the first exam is a week from this coming Tuesday we have today's presentation on micro Theory which gives us for the backbone of the class and then there are two lectures next week that are more topical substantiv Lee topical on research methods and on culture and then a week from Tuesday September 17th is the first exam so once again put that on your radar a week from Monday which is the 16th at 4 will be a review for the test in masks on 281 and that's listed on the test review schedule is posted on the on the class page so are there any questions or details with regards of coming attractions
 I will send you an email probably middle in the next week with some more instructions on just procedurally what you need for the exam scantrons and stuff like that concept of material from last time or anything else related to what we're up to here
 for today we're going to fill out the triangle we're going to drop down and get to the point as it were looking at the third of three theoretical perspectives there are at least three ways of looking at the world are at least three ways to be quote on quote right and
 we talked last time about examining life in countries and we called that macro level examination Big Mac and there are two macro-level perspectives one associating primarily with questions regarding social stability order consensus and efficiency and what is that of the two macro perspectives what is it that's a functionalist point of view in which direction does it lean kind of to the right so issues on a macro country level related to stability order and efficiency
 are functionalist point of view
 related to matters regarding social inequality on a country in a life in a country we call that social
 conflict theory because any quality generates conflict if resources are scarce and everybody needs it and everybody can't get it by playing Fair they will fight get the idea
 so they're just two different ways of looking at life in a country and we're going to drop that down today to look at life in a room and kind of give it a different point of view asking how does a successful Society so much reduce inequality or maintain order but how do successful people use symbols and interpret meanings in order to understand each other we are symbolically interacting
 constant we are
 presenting ourselves in ways that
 either makes us feel good about ourselves or gives us something that others might notice my care about there's a lot of
 raider power in this room lot of red shirts Texas Tech that kind of thing easily understood in a classroom at Texas Tech University as having school spirit and will probably draw people to you in some sent your skin hypothetically if you were sort of flu powdered Harry potter-style out of this room into a room exactly like it with other students doing exactly the same thing in College Station or Austin you would be seen quite differently which you're not
 have a very good friend who is one of four Packer fans in the in Lubbock who's going to be at the game tonight NFL season kicks off Packers Bears in Chicago he's going to wear his Packer gear to Soldier Field tonight he will be seen differently and I've already noticed the 3rd at least two Packer fans in this room thank you very much on Wisconsin Go pass
 I grew up there come on give me a break and all of you are going
 okay fine right
 if I've been giving this lecture at the University of Wisconsin and said gopackgo the room would erupt right
 get the idea symbolic-interaction we want people to know something about who we are and what we're about sometimes and we will wear something or hold something or say something
 put on a costume I'll get to that a little bit later in the lecture to send messages
 so that people will interpret something of what we're about how do successful people use symbols and interpret meetings in order to understand each other words jewelry t-shirts Jester's that's what we're talkin about what time I'm looking at life studying and examining life in a room that's called micro-level analysis and the only micro perspective that we're going to be dealing with in this class this term is the symbolic interactionist or interactionist perspective there are others there is exchange theory there's labeling Theory and quite a number of other micro-level perspectives but we're only dealing with symbolic interactionist Theory because I think it explains most of the rest of it anyway and three is a magic number anyway
 talk to macro one micro
 which sociological perspective would examine or study the body language of a physician in his or her patient is that macro or micro micro so what's the only one micro perspective if that's test question shows up on a test what's the answer as the interactionist perspective and we talk on tuesday which perspective would argue that medicare-for-all provides a scare Surah scarce resource to more people and empowers the poor is that a macro or micro issue that's a macro concern what kind of issues we're looking at life in a country is that concerned with stability or any quality mostly inequalities which perspective would argue in favor of medicare-for-all because it's cost-effective is that macro or micro
 macro or country is it concerned more with stability in efficiency or any quality
 and so the answer is okay that's how you walk through your thinking and I can give you these questions in advance and you'd still have to think it through and that's the point
 think it through reflect look at the strengths and limits of competing perspectives
 a micro-level perspective doesn't tell us much about rates of inflation it may tell us something about what it feels like to have an empty wallet get the idea just a different way of looking at things a lot of us examine Society from where we start and that's fine
 knowing that where we start may be different than where other start and then examine and how those differences generate stability or inequality
 okay let me just put that in context with the other two perspectives with three perspective this is literally the course in one page
 let's get the outline up and we'll go through the the rest of the stuff in the moment
 symbolic interactionist micro level sociology
 we observe and interpret group Behavior based on the exchanging of symbols and if you want symbolic interactionist the perspective in one sentence you can get it from a couple of different sources you can get it from w i Thomas a famous social psychologists the University of Chicago early to middle part of the 20th century who said if men don't you love how these guys talk
 if we perceive something is real or if we Define a situation as real it is real in its consequences and otherwise our perception of reality
 makes it real
 okay who has someone in your life that cares for you very much deeply cares for you and that at least once in your life you have hurt by doing something or saying something who would say that that's okay fair enough let's imagine that you part company at the start of the day and you have plans to meet for lunch alright so meet for lunch or whether wherever it is the restaurant home doesn't matter you me do you hey I got to tell you about my morning and you go
 and something with the person does one of these like all right
 and you go you okay everything alright
 fine
 and if the word fine has two or more syllables
 things are probably not fine right familiar to anybody better than one of these situations and you go you sure yes
 Edward y e s has a snake on the end of it you are about to get bit
 what's up did finally it comes I can't believe you said I can't believe you did that what were you thinking
 can you go and here's the defense that we always try and never works and it will try again the next time we're in this situation I didn't mean it like that
 I meant that way don't matter
 what matters is how it was perceived I'll work it out going to go she ate the meaning of what word or symbol or act or whatever it was that caused things to be somewhat less than fine
 make a point perception is reality you can create perception the last song and today's entry music was the Beatles song Rocky Raccoon off The White Album may not have any notion of that but there's a line in there that if you put it in your head you will understand perception reality and interactionist Theory
 Rocky Raccoon is annoyed because someone has stolen the girl of his fancy
 her name was Magill
 but she called herself Lil
 and everyone knew her as Nancy
 her name was Magill those are the facts that's the objective reality she called herself symbolic interaction in a brilliantly crafted musical lyric
 what we perceive as real becomes real in its consequences and it's real fur
 Miguel Lil and Nancy all at the same time
 50 ideas
 I've given you another page of lecture notes and interactionist view of people and Society what it the next page these first one two three four or so paragraphs I just gone through all of that
 and then a couple of just assessments are assumptions about a symbolic interactionist perspective examining people about stuff we really think through what we want to do how we want to speak we want to make an impression or leave an idea but what we do how we do it depends entirely from a interactions point of view depends entirely on context and that's what I was trying to illustrate when I mess with your head on the Star-Spangled Banner on the first day of class situations and context determine not just what we do but how we imagine what we should do as it were
 we use symbols to communicate we basically except the meaning of flags funeral processions rituals and so on one of my favorite stories
 4 guys playing golf who plays golf it's a weird sport isn't it about the third hole there right next to a major Street can I happens what you want to avoid streets like that cuz you could get a golf ball right in your grill anyway on the Green Street going by what he notices out of the corner of his eye and going by steps away from the pot
 hand over heart hat hat over his heart until the procession passes his partner say we didn't realize that you were so emotional and sentimental about such things while we were married 40 years what do you think
 you know people like that you know golfers just like the Hat
 not in that whole story you'd like and then you're going just like that cuz I changed the perception of it that's happens to all of us all the time and can happen in an instant
 interactions with one another
 Society is buying large artificial I mean we you know we mostly know of economy and all that but again GDP and rates of exchange with what's in our wallet and then we move out we sort of start at the point of the triangle and move up as it were
 macro theorists Karl Marx and durkheim would start up here and then work their way down you know marks wood and Mark actually goes in both directions he looks through the window the factory and comes up with social theory
 durkheim looks at suicide rates and seeks to understand emotion so there's a lot of interplay between the two
 Society is buying large artificial
 and we create a view of society in our own mind micro Theory
 at this point are there any initial questions before I get into some examples and studies
 are you clear on the different sort of looking at the world from below as opposed to looking down on the world from above Martian spaceships or people in a room
 going to talk about this experiment this piece of social research again on Tuesday and then they use it as an illustration of a type of research but I want to tell you about what a researcher did and what happened as a result of this experiment took place in the early seventies at the University of California at Berkley and Berkley is in the General San francisco-oakland Bay Area good lab rats rats we made our living all over the country of the Lab Rats survey respondents it be that as it may anyway she randomly divided into two groups and gave one group 10 or so a bumper sticker it's at slap this baby on your car
 got a group didn't and she said everybody now experimental group and control group for the next month scrupulously without failing exception obey the traffic laws not one mile an hour of the speed limit signal for every turn don't roll through a stop sign at cetera excetera excetera and she was wondering to what effect if any having a bumper sticker on your car had anything to do with the likelihood of being noticed by the police
 anybody want to know what's on the bumper sticker three words Black Panther Party
 okay so well this experiment was done precisely because a month or so prior to Oakland police officers were killed in the line of duty which is horrible allegedly not proven by members of the Black Panther Party the whole big thing in the 60s and 70s
 what do you think happened on this little experiment
 yeah that she had to end it in like a week cuz the students with the stickers that we can't go get gas but you know that kind of the power of three words
 precisely placed at a moment in time
 is one way of illustrating symbolic interaction Theory
 I have five of these illustrations
 how many of you would say that you are actively religious and just say that this is part of my identity that you attend a worship service once a month or more
 once a week
 how many of you would say that if the next time you attended a worship service when you walked in and kind of read the room and you notice that the presiding Minister the one that was going to preach and or administer the sacraments if that person was a woman
 that would be weird
 all the Catholics Church of Christ maybe no girls allowed up in front cuz it were the most interesting people I have ever met
 and sadly I can't remember her name her name we we met briefly when we were both doing some chaplaincy training at University of Chicago way back in 1980
 and I was you know working out of the denomination I was and chaplaincy training was part of being a minister and so on this woman was attending the Catholic Seminary studying to be a priest in 1980 she was also working as a Chaplain and you can get chaplaincy jobs are a little more available to people that are not necessarily ordained but have the private and you have to have the requisite training and so on
 so a lot of us are going you know what the episcopalians allow you in and they're pretty much like Catholics anyway this woman was so
 convinced of who she was as a Roman Catholic but that she was called by God which is a perception to the priesthood not just the other day Ministry there lots of ways to be an ordained minister if you're a woman she was felt called to the priesthood and in a lot of us are going you know when my church is ready macro when my church is ready I'll be ready
 that was 40 years ago I don't know if she's still alive but she's certainly not an ordained priest cuz Church hasn't gotten there yet but what the point of the story is this is who I am and this is how I'm going to live my life as a result of the most interesting ly
 self-aware human beings I've ever met and not just self aware but willing to act on that on that understanding of who she was and I'll respect and I'm a little bit sad that I can't remember her name nonetheless
 number three I asked you to read an article the title to which is as a luster to as is anything in the article why is that important I think that any identity that we claim professor-student child-parent employee Packer fan in some way has to be negotiated you know if you're wearing a bears Jersey and I said yeah yeah
 negotiating the identity is something we do in all of the things that if you don't list who are you you list like 10 things all of those pants renegotiated right I have to hold up my end if I'm going to be a professor I have to effectively profast 22 times in this class and if that's the case has to happen if I don't show up or if I show up in some way that's different or wrong or hurtful it would have to be renegotiated would it not let's imagine hypothetically headline in tomorrow's news story in local news Tech Professor arrested for drunk driving three people injured
 and the story names your professor
 how did your second I got to come to class he's got some explaining to do come Tuesday right my point here every identity we have
 comes under review almost constantly although we don't usually understand it or are aware of it negotiating
 the case of the gay Evangelical
 that's like the Packer fan in a bears Jersey
 how did they do that
 well it's got them out who's something about friendly colleague of mine basically went and lived among or work with and interviewed guys from this that was true we are we know who we are we know where gay guys
 we are Evangelical which is a word that I just clearly understood by most as being Conservative Christian which has by and large enough some antipathy invite us against same-sex relationships typically so how do you how do you do that well we which is sort of a translation or observe the definition of the word gospel which is kind of intriguing
 we call ourselves good news we declare it to be true and we live as though it is and the story that's essentially it
 we know who we are we know we are both gay and we buy into Conservative Christian theology self-reinforcing in a group setting make sense
 we declare to be true
 our name is we call ourselves little I guess would be the night would be the way to the folded into Paul McCartney's lyric
 the case of the gay Evangelical
 Collective identities are not foreign to us right if you were in high school six months ago by a show of hands okay do you still remember the name of your high school mascot and you sort of have left that identity behind who misses being you know we are the Panthers the mighty mighty Panthers that was my mascot at Washington Park High School Panthers good identity
 our mascot identities are collective identities send a message if we are the Panthers the mighty mighty Panthers in his a football game we are saying collectively we will run you down and bite you in the neck right, Google improv bit up here for the next minute or two somebody just yell out your high school mascot name and I will the Chaparral
 chapparells
 I the only Chaparral I know is a roadrunner yeah that's what it is okay we will we will flee
 we will flee another one
 hey Dad the k k dad's what's that
 okay. Okay I didn't know that until we will swoop down on you and Peck your eyes out right or grab you in our Talons and throw you in the lake one more
 Thunderbirds we will get there first
 so you're talking to somebody that you know
 the car that Kevin Hart was was in the wreck in the other day that 1970 barracuda
 if it was a Hemi Cuda that was among the very short listed at that thing could have been worth $1000000
 is that what it was wasn't the million-dollar one
 friend of mine in high school had one paid $3,000 for it wrecked it is about who we want others to see not just us individually we are all of us in this Collective identity really really matters okay tell you how important it is who went to the football game
 for whom was that your first Texas Tech football game pretty cool huh who's in the Band by the way anybody
 I love you man how do you not get a hard time getting to practice from here. Because we go in till 2 after 12
 or 12:30 what part of the band are you in
 yeah I know what do you play or what are you do you play the sax okay what are those unsung heroes in the back there up front
 yeah hey I like the saxophone I like New Orleans I hope that hold you but this isn't it it is choreographed down to the second right
 we got onto the field fight Raiders fight the national anthem The Matador song and then my favorite part after the video thing is a horse running that is my favorite part by far and you're my wife and I have had season tickets forever and we can write for the first time
 who teared up just a little bit be honest I still do I mean it is a big it's a huge it's in a nutshell who we want all of us want to be and have that level of precision and energy right and the the black horse is very striking masked rider outfit is exquisite all of the choreography of that is a first-rate professional Gray
 yeah
 in that cool yeah kids are just drawn to the masked rider in the horse it's it's it's at the core of who we are that's the point
 25 years ago
 does anybody already know where this story is going
 25 years ago was my first football game on the Tech campus and I had that game I was playing north of his plane to Mexico I believe and at that game I saw the horse run for the first time and it did not end well who knows the store couple of you everything was on the band did everything right. Horse starts running it for reasons nobody knows ya something spooked the horse about two-thirds of the way down the horse threw the rider masked rider wind up on the ground continued up around the stadium to the south east corner and up the ramp which is concrete and the horse has shoes on the horse slipped on the concrete fell into the side of the tunnel and die from a 35,000 people I'm not making this up you can a horrible thing first impression of Texas Tech
 actually there been like five horses in my time here in three of them have died in office it is the most dangerous job on campus by far being the horse anyway
 one was killed in a car wreck and another died of of of an illness
 what to do if there was a very brief I thought surprisingly brief conversation about maybe we ought not do this it's clearly dangerous and it is you know horsemanship is not without risk horses are brittle animals they are that conversation lasted about a minute and a half because we would not be us without this okay fair enough we can maybe make it a little safer and they've done some things in the past that have you know that are still in play you know after a touchdown the horse used to run down the field all the way now just can't is a little bit in the off side of the field that in part to protect the rider in the horse
 but the job of being the horse to do this is not easy if you're a horse who knows anything about horses anybody would say
 if you're a horse and you're asked to do this on command by a marching band in front of 50,000 screaming people that is not an easy job if you are wired like a horse's right so you have to either rewire or find an oddball horse to do this
 so they did they found out an interim force in 1994 and then a year later they found the next one and all was well after that but the interim horse was older than this year it had one other problem it was brown
 perfect horse well trained easily adaptable to a very hard thing
 Brown
 got a whole up got to figure this out guess what they did
 they painted it I am not kidding they didn't use exterior oil-based paint that use vegetable dye was fine no horse was hurt by this I have tomorrow off and it was okay and when I first heard that I thought this is urban legend material this is like snakes in the banana drawer at Kmart right or something like that after I've been telling the story is over true so happen the masked rider was in class and I just said am I got this right
 exactly what happened my point is that the level of precision of who we are has to be adequately and fully proclaimed in every single detail right we are not who we are and that sounds silly when you say it out loud until you think of a groups to which you belong and how viscerally important they are
 as it were
 resume examples bumper sticker women in the Pulpit gay Evangelical we are the mighty mighty Panthers or the Thunderbirds and the TCU mascot
 because we are
 ourselves but we are connected and those connections Raider Nation also embedded into a larger culture of college identity sorry that A&M left the Big 12 because that was a that was a rivalry and it was hard to it's hard to read you know where to redo that
 anyway questions or comments to this point
 when introduce you to my favorite that white guy in the whole course Erving Goffman is my favorite dead white guy
 he died in office himself at age 60 while President of the American sociological Association died of a heart attack and left a legacy that is quite remarkable he
 you know when you when you hear there's you're going to go gosh I wish I'd thought of that and had that Legacy he basically argued that to quote Shakespeare all the world's a stage and the players merely actors
 I am in character
 performing a role I chose my costume fairly precisely today decided to wear my shirt off cuz I'm a rebel
 so I'm in character this is how I feel how I feel I can project both professionalism and in some sense casual affability I don't know how well that works but that's my plan right how many as you thought for more than a second about what you put on today or was it just your cleanest dirty shirt
 yeah that kind of thing who would be dress differently than you are right now if you were going to meet for lunch you're brand-new significant other and that person's grandmother whose dress different I got to leave right now
 of course we would
 Kaufman came up with this idea that we are actors and players on a stage and just because I'm occupying the performance region which will Goffman called the front out front
 the front area is where a performance is occurring this is an auditorium this is an effective theater I'm on the stage and I am occupying the role of performer that doesn't mean you are not in character you're in character as student you're writing stuff down you're taking notes on a laptop or for all I know check in Facebook but it looks like you're right and I'm not doing that no I would never do that you're writing stuff down maybe you know front where performance occurs or this class so sucks I hate this I hate this I hate this or something but you're in character playing a role and I think that's something that we do
 can get in and out of all day long who later today is going to be in character as an employee someplace going to go to work who's going to be in the company of someone to whom you are related
 maybe maybe not okay
 who's going to hang out with a pal
 and all of those relationships carry with them different levels of expectations maybe script you know that kind of thing of what we're about in symbolic interaction is this wonderful turn of phrase just 2 words
 impression management for managing the impressions of others by how we act and interact
 I've worked hard on this bit on this act because I knew I would be out front and we all have
 front region activities and responsibilities especially for a brand new relationship
 I think and often said backstage I would say we also have personal space we're not on public view we're at home maybe we're with just two or three people that we care about very deeply in personal space we had to take off the costume you know when I was a minister and on Sunday I would take off the suit in the clerical collar or whatever and it would be nice to be in my own personal space instead of you know right out front like that in such a public kind of way
 Chili's public space in personal space and I think even further back there's what I would call and golf in a litter to private space where you may be the only one in it or if there's anyone else in it it would be only the deepest personal intimate confidence that you have
 I think this is normal and reasonable for appropriate mental health we are not in public space necessarily rewarded for just spilling everything you know maybe you know people you know it's just too much information I don't want to hear about that everywhere you go right
 there's some stuff that you should just leave at home and if you need to work stuff out do it with the people you love the most right
 but I think that there is the I mean there should be some distance there should be some distance between public personal and private but the scope of that distance how far it is I think is an indicator of mental well-being
 especially the private stuff if that private stuff is two blocks from here relative to public stuff back there that you don't want anybody to know
 that can be risky you can be risky just living with it it can be risky if it's exposed another True Story Another Story without a happy ending affect us got a horrible illustrates the point
 public personal
 and private concerns a guy whose family and my family were deer deep and lifelong friends
 the guy in question was born six months after me we're both about the same age he had an older brother that I was also friends with his parents and my parents basically went to high school together and we're lifelong friends literally until all of them were gone and they're still one of them left the pump the parents
 the guy in question was a success he did really well went to college had a job he was in mid-level management at a trucking company made a fair amount of money married a wonderful person they adopted to Korean orphans which is you know quite a noble thing to do he was saying the church choir with the financial secretary at church out front in public you know quite the role model for his family and for people like me who know hey you know what you see what he did you should just maybe you should step it up
 well
 he publicly was notable and laudable in his private life he was a good husband and a father as far as I could tell but his private is person like I'm sorry I get these mixed up in his personal life he had a good family thing going but in his private life he had a secret
 and nobody even his wife knew this secret until it became clear to him that the next day everybody was going to know it
 among his identities husband father choir member executive etc etc
 was babysitter molester
 not good
 and if that ever at any point anybody you know leans in a direction that takes you there
 bring it up to personal and cope with that there are professionals that can help his choice was to leave it there and horrifyingly to all of us it just stunned as he took his own life and he literally couldn't live with who he's known he was and not everybody was going to know
 not good public
 personal and private need to be there but there's a point at which you know if there are things in your private life that are causing you so much pain or more Rich bring it up find somebody to help you deal with it that's what we're that's what that's what they're for the culture is here for
 life is drama you know people maybe that from what you can tell they Nar never out of character
 and you don't ever really know who they are
 Gosman I think his concept of impression management is as useful as anything I know to help us understand we perceive as real becomes real in its consequences
 questions so far
 forgot PIN wrote another book he said the book out of which this concept of impression management comes is called the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and it's a useful book to just look through the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life the other book of many that I would call your attention to is a book entitled just one word stigma we started know what that means you know what title of the book I think is really interesting it's so the subtitle is stigma
 notes on the management of a spoiled identity you know presentation of self talks about managing and identity statement about managing a spoiled identity now that's a very subjective thing and identity that is spoiled
 is open to definition how spoiled by what well Goffman basically argue the physical deformities or blemishes of character or guilt by association he called the tribal stigma
 creates the need to manage a different part to manage that part of your identity anyone who is physically different
 can be stigmatized ridiculed bullied or regarded with suspicion and sometimes especially I mean I was thinking about this you don't even have to be obviously physically disfigured to be stigmatized as a quote on quote disabled person who has an illness a chronic illness let's say the causes perhaps respiratory difficulties
 that legitimately gets the handicap license plate right and they park right up next to the door and then get out of the car and just walk slowly like this into the thing you could imagine a potential confrontation why are you parking there why do you get to do something I don't get to do it you don't look you don't look crippled to me
 there may be stuff you don't know about maybe there's the early stages of Parkinson's going on
 but it's not it's the person's fault to manage that confrontation get the idea
 physical deformity blemishes of character hold drunk driving thing you know that would require me to manage that
 guilt by association tribal stigma
 the best way to illustrate this is in retrospect I showed up in Lubbock at age 40 in the South having lived all of my life prior in the north even growing up in the Jim Crow in the north and it occurred to me in about a week that anybody that was my age or older that grew up in the South lived in a different world
 that if you were not white and you could only find white only bathrooms at cetera that was a different world and that's what got them called a tribal stigma stigmatized by association with other people of similar skin tone or hair texture or whatever
 stop choice of Life Partners sexual orientation is all manners of these things that I've been various ways and in various parts create the need to manage that and this is the important Point Kaufman said that anybody that has a quote on quote spoiled identity and that completely requires context has two jobs one is to cope with it
 and the other is to help other people cope with you what other people at ease when they are in your presence if that's who you are
 imagine being the first African American student at Texas Tech University and that actually happened then you can read stories about the integrating of the University of Mississippi and University of Alabama happening literally with the National Guard's protection
 and what that might mean for the first and only maybe
 in class not only do I have to be the only one here I got to help all of the rest of you cope with the fact that I'm here that's that's that's an issue for Goffman
 edits
 pretty dramatic really there are the textbook example of this is example of a sales person that has let's are burned disfigured face and what the strategy for this level of stigma trying to make a sale it's a sort of these other people into seeing you know the quote on quote spoiled part that's a part of everyone's life that is not if you are not similarly disfigured or when you know it becomes understood all you were the profit was drunk driving 5 years ago yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 I hope you know that becomes a topic on the opening lecture you know where someone for whom that might be true might give a Spiel on the virtues of AA or something like that and sort of recapture a different identity Etc
 the title of this next story is your professor is an idiot
 it's not the last time you'll hear a story that has that same punchline
 this happened about 15 years ago which means I've been at this job 10 years PhD trained very highly experienced teacher of introductory sociology my favorite part of introductory sociology is impression management Goffman and stigma that's my favorite thing and I did something really stupid
 I think I told you on the first day that there were two questions on each test it'll be extra credit and in this class and have been out since the story happened have been you know let go back to grammar school and if you can calculate the area of a triangle or something like that you get an extra point anyway
 when the story took place I had water called lateral thinking questions on the test and you sort of had one in the 10th in quiz on the first day or false the number of single-parent households change if you thought divorce you weren't thinking laterally if you thought divorce and illness that we had to throw that extra winning that's a lateral thinking exercise the Seven Dwarves are don't be silly be happy. Grumpy and so I have to get with who's the tallest one in the house that's a lateral thinking questions some people getting killed himself at all like that the answer is Snow White
 it didn't say the tallest dwarf
 when did wrote on Cinderella I thought that was pretty funny but anyway I am this is the third exam in the class I've been doing this for at least 10 years as I'm passing out the test sitting in the front row is a student who is this tall
 I put a diamond I am not making this up I put a dwarf question on a test for a student is a little person
 so I mean what am I going to do right I just passed him out when he came up to turn in his exam I'm going to talk to you
 I didn't say that
 I said I am so sorry for just being so clueless about that question and he held up his in for my benefit no problem I thought it was funny high five
 he let me off the hook
 these days that would be potentially and actionable mistake you know I mean I could see having a conversation with my chair about and have to go through sensitivity training if I did that
 and he let me off the hook you could have made a huge stink about that rightly so
 but that's his job walking around this tall lives with everyday other otherwise people of decency and integrity
 Steppin in it right
 that's the point
 stigmas noting the man of the manager of a spoiled identity not only means coping with whatever the heck that is it means helping the rest of the world cope with you okay
 questions to this point on any of this material the micro material especially
 I let me then one more time
 go back to where we started and show you one more time the triangle we now have concluded a description and a discussion of three theoretical perspectives all of which are in play on test which sociological perspective and then they'll be a narrative and the test question choices will be functionalist conflict interactions
 every time you hit that take yourself through a thought process and has three at most three sometimes just to the first thing you should ask yourself before you try to answer it I mean you may look at it and go pull my know what that answer is but wait don't circumvent the process especially early on ask yourself are we looking at life in a country are we looking at life in a room macro and micro micro what's the answer
 interaction too. If it's macro you got one more step is it concerned with stability and Order mostly or is it concerned with inequality mostly now tell me you're going to try to overthink this will it could be either if you think about what's it
 the most straightforward answer is usually the right one I am not going to try to trick you into that sort of twisting you know one of the other but which perspective would would support Medicare for all because it provides a scarce resource to the poor is that macro or micro macro is it concerned with stability or inequality inequality so what's the answer that's how you do it
 which perspective would support medicare-for-all because it's cost-effective
 macro micro macro stability or inequality
 answer that's how you do it which perspective would watch the body language between a nurse and a doctor how that's different with the patient macro or micro answer
 that's the drill go to substitute lectures next week have a good weekend go pack go
