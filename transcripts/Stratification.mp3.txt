good morning remember me
 nice to be back we're playing for real now in that there for the second exam one of those two will count and I'm not sure what the status of the postings are there scores will be soon
 just a couple of days later today probably so you will get word on what the second test is and if second verse same as the first of the first verse was sort of a turkey you really need to get in touch with us drop into our office hours we will go over your test Delia says office hours Haley the other ta she works full-time she has more office hours I have office hours just come in and we will we will go over the test with you the mistakes people make tend to Cluster and the fixes for clustering mistakes are not that hard to put in so this is something good that could students do this good students don't necessarily never get difficult grades on exams or papers but good student when that happens as it inevitably does try to put in a fix
 every semester I'm not kidding I get an email from somebody typically that said I just looked at my grades which means they didn't look at him for a while and you should because occasionally the right and say I took test too and that there's no score for it what's up with that and we'll find it we'll fix it but anyway at right about the run-up to test 5 I've missed two tests and flunk One how can I get a B
 missing a test and flunking one doesn't necessarily mean a failing grade in the course if you if you get after it early in the term so now is the time that good students you know really take a look at this and say well where am I a great or where do I want to be and how do I get their fair enough
 I think I owe you another dad joke don't I owe you to write do you know where sheep get their haircut
 at the barbershop
 parallel lines have so much in common. They it's a shame they'll never meet
 we have a for topic segment on stratification and this is where we make our money this this is where we contribute as sociologists to the academy we are the ones that have more or less invented the study of the causes and consequences and costs of diversity
 I know it's like being the best surfer in Fargo but none the last that's our deal all right and I have for presentations in this segment today we're going to talk about the concept of stratification which basically means how do we distribute and what's the rate of distribution in terms of wealth and power and income in the US and then there are some visuals that I hope you'll take with you today and they don't look like what a lot of people think so we'll get to that
 on Thursday we're going to take these ideas and drop them onto the whole idea of sex gender and age and I've got a lecture on that and some of that stuff gets a little edgy you'll notice the sex gender and age segment there are a lot of links and most of them are fairly sure there's one reasonably long research article but the other stuff you should look at ahead of time and then on Thursday week from today are we have something I've never tried before I have a friend who has guests spoken guest lecturer guest back and forth with me in my sociology of religion class that I teach for graduates and also undergraduates every other Spring Hill Dr tombul Hachi who wrote the article that I've asked you to read dr. Bachi is a retired Minister he is graduate training and Classics Latin and
 Greek and also Theology and biblical study and he has written a piece which is essentially we're getting Amber Alerts now
 Cubs going to wait for that to quit because this is important
 he's written a piece that is essentially a Bible study of the book of Galatians now I have a lot of you are familiar with the Bible out of you aren't it doesn't matter but he wrote this little piece of dr. mchottie is a retired minister with the Metropolitan Community Church this is the lgbtq denomination the basically started because a lot of other places don't want us to fairly small denomination and he will be here to talk basically in, back and forth with me when I move the table up and he'll give you something of a story of his own life is on Ministry his take on things and I'll play off of that a little bit I got some data that I'm going to run for you and just reflection and questions about the whole nature of religion and diversity again causes and consequences
 five and it worked really well in an undergraduate class of 20 will see how it works in a group this size so read what he has written talking about that especially if you are biblically minded and if so the Bible yourself read it and ask him hard questions that will take this whole thing I'm doing today some of the visuals that I have and drop them onto a discussion of stratification and race and a two weeks from today will be the third exam essentially the midterm but it's just another exam so Tuesday Thursday Tuesday Thursday of of presentations and then two weeks from today will be the next test turn off preview of Coming Attractions does anybody have at the moment any questions now on details or Logistics or process or
 anything else that happened while I was away
 did everybody get that first five questions free thing
 I thought that was fair given the fact that you had the University of Phoenix one of the lectures
 fair enough
 Sprite to stratify something is to put it in categories
 to stratify income is to put it in categories in those categories tend to be on ladders we are low middle and high rungs on the ladder of achievement of acquisition whatever you want to call it so that's what we're talking about we are talking about creating or looking at or examining or critiquing layers essentially of wealth and power
 what are the first people to look at that at least you and me in this room we know Karl Marx he is one of the first people to have examined the distribution of power which he included in power not just income that you weren't but what you control the means of production autonomy in your life all that kind of stuff and basically said there are two kinds of people in this world there are the proletariat of the bourgeoisie and their interests conflict and they are separated by their relationship to what Marx called the means of production meaning the machines in the factories in the money for the means of production and
 they're actually two kinds of people in this world are those at dichotomize and those that don't
 nevermind forget it later
 but they were took marks as insights fully agreed with them in many ways and added a different dimension Weber talks not only about money power autonomy
 relationships to those who have it if you don't but also prestige
 respect or honor is an element of a component of social classes. Just how much money you make or how much money money you have or of accumulated so Weber borrows from Cooley and Mead in some ways the Looking-Glass self in the emerging self guys and says you know what high-status can mean Prestige as well at least folds at in so I'm a little bit but that's really the end of of that first segment here on Marx and Weber
 what I'm going to do next is go through something you have free access to and should review if there's any you understand but also to look at a little more carefully there's this diagrams from lecture. Right next to the readings and so on and I'm just going to go through some of these and I didn't reset that
 when you talk about the distribution of income and wealth and make a distinction between the two of those and talk about how income and wealth are distributed such that it creates high Rockies and ladders now there is a perception fairly widely held perception that the way you could drop a picture of the rich and the poor and I think a lot of visual images that you hold in your head are really valuable quick sound bites what was the picture
 there's a widely-held perception that the distribution of income and wealth in the US sort of looks like a football and a kicking tee right that there are a few people at the top and a few people at the bottom and we bulge in the middle it doesn't look like that at all
 if there is an opposite to a football that's what it looks like
 look at two separate dimensions of concern itself with Mother concern themselves with money one is in, that's fairly easy to understand how much
 is in the paycheck in a given month that comes into a household and how is it distributed
 10% of the US population
 what that was
 said that the flicker thing is going to bother me so I'm going to see it there and look there and let's try this again
 10% of u.s. households bring in 13,500 a year or less now after taxes that's less than $1,000 a month take home imagine how easy it is for a family of four to live on that
 actually that's about half the poverty line
 making twice that will make families of four anyway eligible for public assistance and the 25th percentile that means one out of four us household bring in less than what is essentially the poverty level so almost 25% of the US population lives in poverty as a way which means that they're eligible for other things like public figure this out 2029 thousand a year divided by 12 is 2400 or so a month after taxes drop down to maybe 1800 a month and take out a house payment student loan car payment nevermind it's all gone
 he said
 the 50th percentile is roughly the same number of people above and below this is the median it's another way of measuring what we call central tendency it's not the average it's the midpoint
 households making 59,000
 exactly have the same number of households who make more and the same number of households that make less I make sense does a pretty good measure of central tendency in let's call it sixty thousand tickets better
 that's 5,000 a month before taxes retirement contributions health insurance deductions and so on a $60,000 income
 that five thousand a month
 gross will net around 3000 3500 a month in living at living resources and you know how a house payment on a reasonably sized house with a 30-year mortgage is going to be $1,000 a month or higher you know so there's a third of it right there and actually lenders will say will lend you the money if you can make the house payment on a third of what you bring home
 in a while at the house cutting it kind of close you begin to see when you see how these numbers
 play out when you just do simple arithmetic
 that a substantial proportion of us households a third or better in some some some some ways of looking at it have a difficult time coping with a $500 emergency you know and that could be a vet bill it could be a dental bill you know a $500 emergency is not suddenly have to have $500 to do something that you can't end the day without doing right that's it that's a stretch for about a third of American households they would have a hard time doing that
 can you give me the Cy 75th percentile three out of four people make three out of four households bring in less than a hundred thousand that's a fair amount of money but again the take-home on that is going to be
 around 5,000 5 5 5 5500 or so and again with the house payment of a couple of car payments and a student loan you starting to see that there isn't as much left over as you would think and then we start to get to the higher dollar households 9 out of 10 make less than 170
 95 out of a hundred make less than 2 and 1/4 and the 1 percentile the one that percentile approaches a half a million dollars of household income a year so you begin to see that the distribution of that if you were to sort of Leia shape on top of those numbers it would look a lot more like a triangle then it would a football and a kicking tee right
 point at the top down like that
 now that there's a graph below this that these are the same numbers and it just gives the comparisons between 2016 to 2017
 I want to take
 another look at what really divides us more than income however know there's a pretty big disparity there's a 30 full difference between the top one and the bottom 10 but that doesn't really measure how widely dispersed resources are is generally understood his net worth how much net worth do you have how do you calculate that imagine everything you own or control in your household not involve a couple of cars maybe
 TV sets baseball card collection every pots and pans you know they sold everything and I got a number in the checking account
 and then you start writing checks against that number of everything you've sold to cover everything you owe pay off the house pay off the cards pay out that cars pay off the student loans and so on whatever's leftover that's your net worth
 now it's not hard to imagine I think from the standpoint of an 18 to 22 year-old of which most of you are that in 10 years you're going to have hopefully a good salary maybe right at the median or a little higher 60000 imagine who would say that job out of college 60k I would take that
 you might have negative Network you might have a good salary but you might have negative net worth because when you start paying off your house the mortgage dollars that go to the bank basically paid mostly interest of $1,000 house payment on a quarter million dollar house first that's how the banks make their money and then you start eating into the principal and so on so in a couple of years you've been making house payments but the house is actually your upside down on it you know you haven't paid off as much as it would as you would need to be able to pay it off and still have money left over
 so you going to be upside down for a while and you know after 5 or 10 years and I'll thinks you make more money to start paying it down and so on things stabilized but 10% of the US population is underground all the time
 they could not if they sold everything they had they could not pay off their bills they would there they're underground and only give you the numbers on that to see the difference between the bottom 10% in the top 1% with regard to net worth 10% of the u.s. population is at least $1,000 in the hole and you can see that at least 10%
 could not only not handle a $500 emergency would be hard vanilla $5 emergency they have less money than they owe
 1 out of 4 and net worth of 10250
 why the health care plans have an out-of-pocket minimum of our max out of pocket minimum of ten thousand feet up your entire savings by getting sick easy even if you have good health insurance the midpoint almost was a hundred thousand in the bank that sounds like a lot but imagine you want to retire and you work hard and your Social Security payment will be two thousand a month that's not uncommon for a guy who's 66 now I know exactly what months and 2000 that's not that's a start I'll just leave off my retirement I have a hundred thousand in the bank how long can you two thousand a month is 24000 a year
 I don't make I make a lot more than that now how long is 100000 going to last if you're trying to live on $50,000 a year and your Social Security gives you 24 to the last four years that's even going up to the 75th percentile and rounding it up to 400,000
 the object of the game at retirement is to be able to take Social Security as a base and live off that plus the earnings of your Investments That is whatever you have in the bank
 whatever interest you can get from that call that income and live on that and Social Security that's a way to live prudently in retirement can't count on more than about a 5% return on an investment if you invest it in order to keep it I mean you can maybe get more if you put it in lottery tickets or start-up stocks but you might lose it all like that so 5% 5% of $400,000 seems like a lot even 5% of a half a million in the bank
 10% of that is 50,000 5% of 25000 that another 2,000 a month so 4,000 a month can you live on that I don't know how you going to replace the cost of the health insurance your company pays for when you have to buy a Medicare supplement policy
 I'm talking like this because this this
 right way in the future my point is
 if you talk to somebody who's your parents age or older and you probably won't learn this but you know a million dollars doesn't go as far as you think that's what's intriguing and then when you add that to the fact that only one in 10 has even that
 it shows you how hand-to-mouth a lot of our culture is with regard to finances
 and how far away the wealthiest are 10.4 million one out of 110.4 million will give you a comfortable retirement no questions asked for would probably do that as well but that's only five out of a hundred
 people you know
 now I've done something with these numbers to give you a visual football in a kicking tee boom triangle illustrative but I'll give you one more picture I have converted these numbers these units of money to units of distance what's imagine that every dollar up there
 equals one inch of distance and I've converted that to a diagram I'm going to have to knock this down a little bit and it'll be hard to see or read I should say but you have this how you had access to it
 75% of us live within about six miles of the ground or below three out of four 10% of us live underground in the basement so there's this big foundation close to the ground where three out of four people live you want to take that up to the next 24%
 up to the next up to the to the 95th percentile you're about 37 miles up that's not very far
 you want to go up to the wealthiest 1% what's 165 miles away
 they have no idea how we live do they you know I mean that's it. This is a visual that suggests that now it's not a football on a tee it's not even really a triangle
 if this was a famous International landmark in Europe what would it be what does it sort of look like
 where in Europe could you go see a structure that kind of looks like this
 and what would you see in Paris and would see the Eiffel Tower the distribution of wealth in the US in the US looks a lot like the Eiffel Tower well what does that mean well we'll talk about it what it means personally but now I'm going to take this to an extreme
 don't you love it when I do that
 I do not have the top 10 wealthiest Americans for 2019 because it is not yet but these are the 10 wealthiest people okay this is well on average with the 1% of 10.4 million the top 10 people in the Forbes 400 Forbes Magazine puts out the 400 wealthiest Americans and these are the 10 individuals that were in the top 10 in 2018 Jeff Bezos beating Bill Gates I think for the first time Jeff Bezos being the Amazon guy you know a lot of these names you know that you might know the first four you certainly know the three out of four Warren Buffett is a long time investor he owns The Berkshire Hathaway company I'll Larry Ellison is in computers Larry Page on the internet Uncle Chuck and Uncle Dave the Koch brothers now the late David Koch who died just a few months ago
 are 6 and 7 and 8 6 and 7 and 8 and also in the entertainment business
 160 billion dollars what does that mean 52 billion dollars what's that were first of all the word billion
 is a word that doesn't have much meaning in and of itself but let me remind you and you know this from 5th grade arithmetic a billion is a thousand million If I Was A Millionaire or billionaire a billionaire would have a thousand of me so there's a thousand to one ratio their baseball bag you can stop a million dollars in there instead you know bricks of hundreds pick it up 25 lb or so
 now let's imagine the space that it would take in this room to put a thousand of those duffel bags in there
 to make a billion I'd probably get crowded off finger when I maybe
 now imagine the poorest of the top 10 having 52 of those leftover that's the net worth that's the money in the bank that you know even a 5% rate of return is going to be pretty darn good
 can let's put this into perspective in 60 billion crap and by the way 78 of that from Jeff Bezos he learned well his company earned this is the basically the poet the price of Amazon stock has done
 he went from less than a hundred billion poor guy 260
 in one ear
 okay let's try to put this into perspective a little bit okay the net worth of the Forbes 400 the 400 wealthiest Americans is 729000 million dollars
 400 people have more wealth have more money in the bank have more left over money than zero then all African Americans in the United States 100 people all African-Americans interesting
 if you just look at Bezos Gates and Buffett they have more well
 then half of us and there's what 340 million in the US now a hundred and seventy million people have the same amount of leftover money as Bezos Buffett and Gates three people that's kind of billionaires
 26 people let's count on 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 and one more billionaires now the width the richest 26 billionaires in the world have the same amount of money as half the rest of us
 3.8 billion people equals 26
 let's get spooky that's a pretty tall Eiffel Tower
 let's try to put this into some more accessible comparisons we with our Healthcare System as it is we provide Indigent healthcare free we do it in the most expensive way you can imagine that is by hospitals writing off what they what they what they spent on for people to come in now the good news is a lot of poor people that would otherwise come to hospitals to get scared for when I get sick don't make it there they die early they die first and that means hospitals don't have to write that money off
 wait a minute did you just say the mechanism for caring for the poor cost people their lives
 38 billion a year American hospitals just write it off that's what it cost to take care of the 4th
 where does that come from it comes from the premiums people with health insurance pay
 it gets added into the amount of money that Tech takes out of that that take Tech gives to me and compensation let's say for Blue Cross Blue Shield health care coverage over $1,000 a month
 what's just hypothetically look at the earnings of Bezos Gates and Buffett if they earn 5% that would be prudent investing there in 5%
 on their net worth would fund all of indigent care for 7 months almost over half a year that would fund Indigent care now that's just the 5%
 the aggregate net worth of these three people went up 37% they did way better than 5% if you would take a 5% investment return would rather have a 37% investment return yeah who wouldn't
 it helps if you have a lot of money to begin with
 that 94 billion dollar increase just the interest on those three people's net worth would fund Indigent care for 2 and 1/2 years
 we would not have to pay for healthcare for the poor the rest of us just on what they earned and interest not nobody I know
 would suggest that the top 10 are the shoulder that level of responsibility that would be insane
 but I want you to know this
 got a lot of people who live at the top of the Eiffel Tower say the government shouldn't
 somebody else should well who else is it all the rest of us basically
 the total 729 billion dollar net worth of the top 10 is equal to 20 years worth of indigent care that's what we could get for what they have should they give it up for that purpose of course not
 but it illustrates how concentrated so much wealth is and what else could be done with that much well there enough just numbers and I'm asking you to think about
 so the average net worth of the top 10 is 73 billion dollars let's just the average top 10 wealthiest
 let's just convert dollars to distance for a while on that 73 billion dollars
 the distance the top tens average from the ground where the rest of us live 130 Mi and the ground are the same
 using my iPhone tower construction bottle the top 10 live 1152246 mi from us
 how far is that all you can read it roughly the distance between here and the moon times 5 over the old Ralph Kramden Honeymooners TV show look it up on YouTube to the moon and back and back again and back here and then you can stay there five times that's a no wonder it's hard for a lot of people in that category to see what's going on
 okay that's insane
 but I want to leave you with some visuals
 we kick the football out of here the triangle the Eiffel Tower
 a round trip ticket to the Moon * 2 and 1/2
 put some perspective on the distribution of wealth and power
 what does this mean
 a metaphor that kind of looks like the Titanic doesn't it 19
 12 13 14 something like that
 a first-class passenger 338 first-class passengers 40% died in the wreck 60% survived so if you are a first-class passenger and it hit the iceberg what were the odds flip a coin little better than that
 2nd class 56%. Flip a coin not quite as good these are Vegas odds in a good Casino house Edge on this one is 6% will take that
 Don and Leonardo DiCaprio Bill where the fun happens you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about
 1 out of 4
 a surviving that's a metaphor for what
 material comfort and life chances are
 the further up you go in the Eiffel Tower they just get better
 and where does a lot of that money come from but look you should look at the Forbes 400 and find out how many especially the women the few women that are on their relatively speaking are on that because of someone they they were born to or we were married inheritance covers a lot of this
 just a metaphor
 I gave you at the start a football on a tee which we have kicked out of the room we have a triangle for income
 where are the Eiffel Tower
 for wealth
 we have a very long trip to the moon and back for the wealthiest of the wealthy
 and in general terms the closer you are the first class the better you will do in every measure of Life chances questions
 there's obviously a lot of well-being and people otherwise
 no it can't just be prepared
 the question whether was asked is how did those people get so wealthy
 where they talk about this in the race lecture but here's a preview of Coming Attractions when you look at well by race and I'm going to show you this so I just this is Junior hear this again but it did answers your question African American Wealth is 20 sometimes less other Angela well that number could be wrong cuz I don't have to lecture in my head
 but it's incrementally different than non-white well and the major reason for that is inheritance is inheritance the wealthiest of the wealthy got most wealthy because of someone to whom they were born or someone they married who they outlived essentially so the answer your question
 Mark's actually called inheritance theft he thought Marx argued that inherited wealth that was preserved by people that did not earn it rather than distributed for the good of everybody in a sense was stealing from others now that's a tough sell anywhere on Earth but that's sort of the that's the opposite of what I just told you
 other questions
 okay I'm going to refer you now to a little in class exercise that's on the study guide the second page it's called a social class and life chances questionnaire I want you to imagine your own self and your own household and I want you to check these 13 questions that have a b c d answers that you can just take out a blank piece of paper and just make a column or did you have this credit I'll just do it on on the thing I'm going to leave the first nine up there and in a minute or two when you get far enough down I'll give you the other for there are 13 questions on this little on this little instrument
 so just give yourself an A B C or D answered all of these
 oh one other thing stop for a second one other thing
 as you give yourself an A B C or D put a point value to those answers
 answers are worth for
 B answers are worth 3C answers are worth 2D answers are worth 1 and already the women are going to screw this
 right
 so what you got a 13 questions Each of which have a point value assigned to them at 1 to 4 so the highest score you can get on the social class and life chances questionnaire is 52 the lowest score would be 13 so just play with us for a little bit and and in a second here I'll scroll the last four questions
 not yet
 Travis what what's Protestant Protestant is Baptist Presbyterian not Catholic but Christian okay
 that's a subjective thing number 8 just do the subjective just make a gas it we're not we're looking for painting this with broad with a broad brush folks
 let me just ask cuz this is coming into shape for you or is these numbers are coming into Focus for how many of you does it look like you're going to clear 25 on this anyway
 40
 those are the sort of thresholds that the developers of this questionnaire have for reasonable odds of upward mobility and material Comfort not doesn't account for things like a Health crisis and so on but just on average
 these are the characteristics and the point values assigned such that 25 3540 or so or above
 the odds increase dramatically it having a material comfortable upwardly-mobile life
 now again folks a lot of this stuff has to do with just where and to whom you were born right
 here's my here's a point I want to make sure you can look at this later if you haven't finished it up let's just look at the top four or five
 put the answers in the top four or five questions here are the characteristics that begin to predominate in ways that are
 disproportionate to the their numbers in the general population
 the further up you go in the Eiffel Tower the further up you go on the Eiffel Tower you do you do you run away from a 50-50 split between male and female you start having disproportionate numbers of men the further up you go
 you start having disproportionate numbers of white men the further up you go you have disproportionate numbers of white male Republicans who are married and Protestant the further up you go and I'm going to give you a little sound bite on a lot of that stuff at the very end of this lecture this is just again to give you
 just a visual on who you hang with more than not the further up you go in the Eiffel Tower
 it's just an exaggeration other way of saying a lot of the same things that I've said to this point
 again now any questions or comments
 we're going to ship to
 I think you get to pick
 I would I would pick 4 and that's really sad isn't it to think about that you're a martian that wanted to place a bet that's what you would do you know
 not I think there was a time when he has to question was if your vibrational would you pick other and I would put you there was a time when I think something about the fifties now where someone who is of mixed race would be seen as they would never presume that this was a quote on quote illegitimate birth some guy black girl pregnant or something and then left her that would be the pink and and I think there was a level of denigration at that point and I'm just shooting from the hip here but that's a very good question and and I think less so now in fact now that I think of it so you get me think of the number to start go away where is that
 there is a body of literature and I'm going to tell you a really hard story about a girl who asked a question to my classmates
 there's a body of literature that suggests that even among let's say African-Americans for the moment
 that the lighter the skin the more social value to the person that really dark skinned minorities are seen differently and let me give you an example of this I was teaching a night class in medical sociology was just do as a senior-level class and I was a woman in the class who is a registered nurse and often the charge nurse she was supervising registered nurse and we were talking about this and she just happened to be very dark skin and she sort of tentatively raised her hand and said I'm not sure I can get through this story
 and she said to make more money I will sometimes pick up extra shifts and nurses can do this it's a really it's a really useful something that that are in can do so just put their name and it's like being a substitute teacher they can put their name on a list and another hospital will call them and say can you work Pediatrics midnight to 7 today so they go do it and she said I do a lot of that cuz I'm trying to get through school and I got a couple kids and again I'm very dark-skinned highly-trained charge nurse RN type she's got a job as a charge nurse in one of the hospital
 and she said
 often is not when I do that and I come to the floor and no one knows me they think I'm the nurse's aide
 and I went
 and at that point you had a hard time continuing the story and she does not just cuz I'm black but because my skin happens to be so dark I was just stunned by that store and I never forgot it and that happened 15 years ago but there's a research literature that suggests that and some commentators have suggested that former President Obama has an African American who is of mixed race
 probably would not have been elected had he not been of mixed race or had very dark skin that's just a hypothetical
 but the highly trained supervising charge nurse that unless proven otherwise is that Nurses Aide
 is one of the most powerful stories I have ever had a student tell me a dad goes to this whole issue and I really appreciate that everybody gets this it's one of the most compelling thought pieces that's ever come to me from student
 okay that was good I just killed it all now I got to reboot everything hold on
 I love Googling myself anyway
 don't you do that don't you love doing that ever do that
 I don't want my parents to Google me they'll see the time I got arrested
 okay we're down here to what produces this inequality the unequal distribution of wealth money and power all of that is in the diagrams I just showed you
 what produces this
 division of labor we had we divide up the work more profoundly than we used to the simplest way of organizing a culture is in hunters and gatherers two jobs pretty much equal stratification no differentiation and social class the more specialized weekend the more stratified the Eiffel Tower taller through specialization of work now some of that has there been an upside to the in the last generation and a half or so the childcare industry didn't exist to the extent that it does in the 50s because we typically had one household earner bringing it all the money now we up to that has been the result of two things one women are getting more access City to at 2 to the economy is at work and these days in America it just costs What It Takes Two incomes to buy in terms of it
 I will have a comfortable life
 so the childcare industry is a job we didn't have and there are lots of other Specialties and subspecialties that contribute to the height of the Eiffel Tower my story on This concerns a really good friend of mine is a retired physician and I played softball with you for years and we were watching the game ahead of our games free games and we're playing the middle games or watching the game and the batter rips went down the third-base line and 50 year old guys and olders reflexes are not Greatest Hits him in the forearm and arguably broke whatever it is the radius to the ulna and the shortstop happen to be a paramedic and so he's looking at him and everybody's working it out in my friend the position is sitting next to me I go I go look at it
 cuz I didn't hit him in the kidney
 I broke my my my position friend was a nephrologist he studied the kidney so his job specialization to go to my very good friend
 he was on my team again this last season one of our end at least four times during the season one of our guys fell got hit by a ball one guy looks like he collapsed with chest pains on the way to first base and my buddy the nephrologist tended to them nicely he's not a he's not a bad person at all but he assessed the situation forearm not critical there's a paramedic looking at them I'll stay here get the idea specialization
 to the more of that you have the more stratified your Society is the higher the Eiffel Tower these are the things that build the height and expand the base of the Eiffel Tower
 we also evaluate and Ranch jobs different
 this is where Prestige comes in I talked about Vapor early in the in the lecture Weber argued that occupational Prestige is something you can trade you can trade that for resources in your life whether it's autonomy whether it's opportunities for extra money if people see you
 as a person of Honor that's actually an extra chip at the table and social class
 interesting lie enough oh well and the the top 10 professions in the US tend to be also High Prestige what would you guess is the most prestigious profession in the US economy
 and I guess
 physician is in the top 10 or the difference between a catfish and a lawyer is
 what time is a bottom-feeding scum sucker and the other is a fish
 nevermind airline pilots in the top 10 secondary education teachers which are overwhelmingly men dominate in the top 10 college professor sometimes number two so I went from full-time clergy to full-time college professor I felt upwardly-mobile right to be frank and honest guy come out of your other professional clergy some of these scandals with priests and others have really put a hurt on The Prestige of quote on quote man of God and rightly so it's horrible
 hey where you get the idea so these are the sorts of folks that are in the top 10 they're almost always disproportionately male occupations and their attached to high levels of prissy anybody that child of a physician anybody usually get one or two nobody and what's dad's subspecialty
 deposition
 Anderson art therapy is he a surgeon or cardiologist both
 so he does Stenson all like that he's right at the Forefront of that do people think that you're smart because your dad's a doc like in high school everybody wanted you to be their lab partner so they figured you out early enough yet I'm going to be a sociologist don't want no harm done here but when people know that your dad is a position did you catch some spillover that in terms of people seeing you differently little bit anybody administers kid
 nobody's owning up to that anybody know a Minister's kid
 who would say think of The Minister's kid that you know who would say member I started out front stage and backstage while ago who would say that The Minister's kid you know and you see at 10:00 on a Sunday morning is a different person than you might see at 9 at night out in public
 Sprint talk about hypocrisy later in the term just thought I'd point that out
 mid-level prestigious occupations tend to be people like Funeral Directors administrative assistance assistance to assistant Chiefs hiring managers accountants in terms of prestige make a lot of money my brother-in-law bathroom fixture salesman we used to call him the colonel of the urinal okay that was cruel they made a lot of money
 and with some of that money he's an avid golfer got a membership to a really nice country club and country clubs are in business to sell Prestige no matter what you do sell toilets who doesn't need three
 good idea at the Country Club he's Mister so-and-so and treated with deference and that's a useful thing so you can buy Prestige there and there are there places in the economy that sell at country clubs would be one of them down at the bottom
 among others wait staff have a short little Riff on this and I think it is a Straits some of what all this stuff says more about the rest of us than it does about the people I'm talking about Who's Who currently or ever has been paid to wait tables
 who would say it's a pretty sucky job yeah you talked about having to defer to everybody let's pretend you're about social class earthlings write what you know about earthlings is that they require food to survive
 what you know about earthlings if that there are places on Earth buildings where people who need food go to get it and inside those buildings are the people who bring it to the holy cow who do we need more than that the rest of it the thing that puts wait staff on the bottom of the list is all crap we've invented right
 I think you should tip minimally 20% to someone who's willing to give you food and clean up after you write
 if it don't people have done this it going yeah who would say if you've ever had that job that sucky job that the suckiest time of the week to do that sucky job is noon to 2 on Sunday before I hardly got Sunday outright why who shows up at restaurants from noon to 2 on Sunday the church Crowd Oh My Gosh I've been I've been doing that bit for 25 years and every time I do it I as one who's a minister I take a breath and go
 people leave church and go to restaurants angry and stingy
 what is 1/2 what happened in the mature to put them in that mode I'm the one that sends them there
 I'm retired now it's no longer my fault
 and I think you know the more the more rational example is that no restaurant on the planet can afford to staff a restaurant to handle the church crowd so everybody's overworked that's the problem
 but I will say this
 you and I
 are served by people who are doing unpleasant work and sometimes get chippy about it right
 and you should not
 punish them for that you should try to understand and the reason you should not punish them for it if they will get even
 who knows somebody that ever fouled somebody's meal because they got chippy with him or something to that effect we were sworn to secrecy I know it happens there's a better example at this point of this lecture many years ago 15 + young woman raised her hand and said I don't think I should tell you which particular specific American Airline she work for
 but you said one guy she was the one that takes the your bags and punches your ticket and send you to CSA she said I'd had it one day with one too many people giving me a reports where people just give the ticket-taker more crap than any human being deserves she said he was going to Portland his luggage went to Peru
 whoops
 she said I got written up for that at the bet you did she said it was worth it I bet it was
 I remembered that story was here to later as of a conference in Miami and the airport got socked in with a thunderstorm that happens all the time in Miami in the spring it's just what happened before the days where you could read book yourself on your phone and all that kind of thing but to stand in line get rebooked in the person ahead of me was going all I'm entitled to this poor clerk that just got buried
 well actually it was her fault that the thunderstorm yeah right I mean it was still listen to the guy that was haranguing her that's what it sounded like
 did a guy I said how you doing having fun yet
 Miami why would you want to spend another night in Miami right well I get my boarding pass
 just cuz I cracked a joke I get to sit up there with the people that buy up ahead of me in the Eiffel Tower was in graduate school I had no money
 just was great
 it doesn't hurt to be nice and one last thing in this in this piece and I'd this is new in this lecture and I just thought of it during the last lecture because you know I'm of an age where can I your life gets a little more complicated inside get simpler in some ways because more complicated and I have learned just in the last couple of years because my life is somewhat complicated personal Wyatt just cuz I'm an old hippie with you in a functionary position
 I wanted to speak as I get chippy with people sometimes and then feel bad about it sometimes with students
 it's entirely possible the next person that you know
 I don't know how to say it the next clerk that isn't what the clerk's oughta be and you're tempted when you get the email from Starbucks how was your experience getting latte the other day you're tempted to give him a to that might get them fired all these surveys anything less than a 5 is a zero in a lot of places my son my step-son sells Toyotas and the buyers experience even less than 5 once or twice will cost the salesman important
 that's going to say How I Feel It chords you're not the next time somebody gets chippy with you it could be that in their life is some shit you know nothing about
 can you give me the benefit of the doubt it doesn't hurt right take a breath you might be 10 seconds later to your next thing to do
 take a breath and imagine maybe you don't know the whole story in this transaction and that's you're not going to get that perfect and I am not either cuz I am prone to let loose the part of my personality that does not suffer fools lightly I don't
 evaluation and ranking and then we pay people differently based on the value of their work at least as we understand it and this again says more about us than it does a culture about the people getting that money the way we pay categories of people says more about the culture than it does about the people we pay fair enough
 if you thought about it for a second
 you might be able to come up with the name the actual name of the person
 who works for the State of Texas I'll tell you it's a he he is a Public Employee he basically gets paid with your tax money right which public employee gets the most who's the highest paid Public Employee in the state of Texas anybody know
 if you even know what he does that would be a plus
 Public Employee guess
 he works for a school that is correct what does he do at that school
 I gave it he works for University
 which coach
 no he used to be the UT Austin football coach and then Jimbo Fisher at A&M got seven and a half million
 so it used to be the used to going way back to Mac Brown until Jimbo Fisher's contract of a year or two ago where were the UT football coach was the highest paid Public Employee football season tickets forever I love college football game Saturday holy crap
 I mean serious underdogs that I pasted them awesome it was great
 it's expensive Matt Wells makes little over 3 million
 I make a decent salary but it's way short of that
 but it's fine I can make enough to buy season tickets good good Square although in Kingsbury got fired I thought
 as it were
 but again even the wealthiest of the wealthy football coaches not what I think Nick Saban is the highest paid Public Employee in America he coaches that easy head coach at Alabama 10 million something like that that doesn't touch of Forbes 400 doesn't touch it so and I think there's some there's some mode perspective to be gained that way the things that build the Eiffel Tower we divide up the work we evaluated subjectively and then we evaluate it materially and that creates the Eiffel Tower
 questions or comments
 this next piece will go quickly this is a preview of coming attractions in every lecture that concerns itself with Healthcare family politics and government the economy religion there will be a significant stratification piece of functionalist and conflict and social class peace with everything but this is sort of like the trailer for the lecture on Healthcare this is the trailer for the lecture on family
 with regard to health care in the US as it as it relates to the Eiffel Tower
 well makes health
 there are a lot of things that contribute to the probability of living a healthy life the heavyweight champion of all the things that contribute to that money Healthcare is still something we buy and if you don't have any money you line up at the ER assuming you can crawl your way there before you die
 Got Over States it but by less than you think
 well creates well-preserved preserves Health cuz basically we're all terminal
 give yourself a few years
 Kurt didn't wait a second. Today
 family
 poverty kills family I think I mentioned that to you before on day one when we talked about whether or not
 Christian fundamentalist households were less vulnerable to divorce no they're not because so many things contribute to it and the big killer of families the big killer of marriages his money or more accurately the lack thereof
 politics
 it was 2010 the Supreme Court ratified a case called citizens united write that down citizens united
 and in that case was brought forward by a political action committee by a lobbying group that successfully argued before The Supreme Court that political contributions
 4 equal to free speech
 and could not be abridged
 the Koch brothers Charles and the late David Koch in the 2016 election both for Congressional candidate for the president in political contributions between the two of them that a hundred billion so you know 1% that's not bad
 and here's the sound bite with regard to politics and I think it is becoming more obviously the case if not more prevalent Lee the case where are were more aware of this I think in the last 5 years or so or certainly since citizens united it's a metaphor the sound bite is a metaphor
 the one who pays the band fix the song
 the one who pays the band pics the song why do you suppose there was a massive fundraising solicitation for the Trump re-election campaign as soon as the impeachment debate
 people will put their money where they wanted to go as it worked and you know one of the ways that the potential success of Democratic primary candidates now his how much money have you raised
 so the sound bite in
 in my terms and if the one who pays the band pics the song
 I know I wouldn't pick Achy Breaky Heart
 religion is an interesting one the sound bite hear the words that will carry what I'm going to tell you are those these three words the Protestant establishment the Protestant establishment
 the US was founded by basically three types of religions by 3 by people who are of one of three types of religion Episcopal Church they became a Piscopo episcopalians in the u.s. today is the Church of England
 brought to America so you would expect the caught the colonial. To be riddled with Episcopalian Presbyterian Church of Scotland same story and congregationalists hybrid now known as the United Church of Christ these are the three Protestant establishment denominations that together comprise less than 2% of all religions of all religious people and yet they will occupy about half of the Forbes 400 about half of the president cabinet about half who's who in America any measure of wealth and power is disproportionately dominated by almost always male
 Presbyterian Episcopal are congregationalists now UCC in the politics lecture but for now the Protestant establishment
 the economy has everything to do one's place in the economy has everything to do with access and I want you to put a little / your economy and education because the sound bite has to do with that in a functionalist world the educational system feeds the economy provides skills training Prestige to get a good job
 the sound bite
 Legacy admission
 and I know what that means
 trying to get into college what's a legacy admit what is that what is that mean
 yeah it's a you get a little extra chip at the poker table if you are the child of someone who is an alarm or the grandchild or if it's an uncle if they gave a lot of money right other words you get a you get a little extra because of the really good job you did picking your parents right
 and then we have Felicity Huffman and Lori Laughlin and that gang not quite good enough
 oh my gosh and then the rest of us are going you know what it just doesn't help to play by the rules but just do whatever we know how to do and whatever we can get around that. Doesn't help but the Legacy admin access is not equal access to education access to the economy is not equal
 and finally government I'm going to reboot something I told you about in the last segment on deviance why did that whole roleplay about the criminal justice system
 all things being equal in government is in charge of the Criminal Justice System essentially they either are running the prisons are there hiring somebody else to do it and overseeing it
 the general population all things being equal if you're from Mars This is what you'd expect to see X percentage of males females anglos not anglos whatever the general population is that distribution ratio all those numbers should be exactly the same as what we see in prison which we don't girl justice system is heavily biased against just demographically young non-white males end of story it is sort of the heavyweight champion of racial discrimination in the US the rich get richer and the poor get prison Reese heard that before that's the sound bite or government
 can citizens united Place into this in a lot of other things due to
 okay so in some today we have the football we kicked out of the room
 we have the triangle sort of in
 fuzzy terms that the Eiffel Tower
 as the image that's describes the
 distribution of wealth in the US grab the Titanic what is that distribution mean
 and we have a trip to the moon and back
 and to the moon and back and back to the Moon where the really wealthy live
 questions
 that's how we divide up the money
 where can I buy used to that with the football coaches sound
 thank you
