okay good morning I swear Socrates could not Teach an American University today with all the gadgets you got to have to make it work okay. So that's good. The test was easier than you anticipated
 okay that's fine that means you're here you're starting to get this stuff harder than was anticipated okay who figures I got exactly what I paid for
 scores I'll be up there tomorrow and they're out of 50 so we're not we're not big on figuring averages although I guess you could have been 54 possible points in whatever your total is rabbit in the test in 254 would be your running average but when you learn what your score is if that comes as a shock wow I keep doing it or maybe not so much all of us both to you and I have office hours that are listed on the website they are drop in and we have we have the documents of what questions you missed every student get I get an output it's a big long PDF file and every student has one sheet where they have all of the questions that has the answer key and the questions you missed so we have that and we can go over it with you and you should do that
 sooner than later every semester literally someone comes in my office usually in the run-up to the fifth test and says something to the effect of I flunked two and missed one how can I get a B
 you know on the other hand if you come in to see one of us now and Seth want the test how do I get an A easy we dropped this test it doesn't come and then we go over it with you and usually there's a pretty simple set of bug fixes that we can put in just in terms of how to approach the thinking process so don't wait what if you're a first-semester college student don't wake good students work stuff out and and you know figure out what the patterns are that are causing the trouble and what the patterns are there helping them succeed and you focus on the ladder okay
 and if all that didn't help I played music that I thought was apt for socialization a couple taught things about getting by With a Little Help from My Friends your mother should know and the song Julia by John Lennon The Beatles John wrote that for his mother but at the very end of the song Teach Your Children
 the last line is and know they love you so no matter what your test score is your mom and dad still love you. Okay and we'll move on based on that
 are there any questions about details or Logistics or any other such matters
 literally second verse will be same as the first
 45 fit 10% of the day at the end of the course there are 270 possible points 24 rabbit and 25045 test 27 from 270 to 43 is the iso that at the end of the day it's a 10% cut off
 and what else if anything
 El every test in the course will look and sound exactly like that one there will be 50 questions 15 or so of which 15 or 20 will be true-false and the rest will be multiple choice maybe a third of the multiple-choice ones will be vocabulary so flashcards and perspectives and Please be aware that on the next test all perspectives are in play this whole segment of the class segment 2 is by-and-large entirely on the micro level
 not exclusively but mostly on the level of interaction we can talk about socialization today which means developing and identity we're going to talk about deviance which means violating rules in the company of others we're going to talk about groups and organizations and social structure and interaction mostly occurring in Life as we know it in rooms with other people so that's the whole gist of this second segment the third segment is the diversity piece where we make our money in sociology and then we'll have two segments on the social institutions family religion education Healthcare government economy and then a wrap up and you seen pretty much the full drill and it's just going to be more of this fair enough
 well socialization is sort of the first place we start with the development of social psychology basically and I have for you three more while two more to new dead white guys and then revisit of Goffman definition of socialization is just a synonym for it one word
 housebreaking
 teaching the rules rewarding Conformity becoming civil and social that's what we try to do and there are some theoretical foundations to this and all of this goes to the development of a sense of self
 and identity we project to others and how it feels to live inside our own skin that's essentially what we're talking about here George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley are sort of the
 the Dutch uncles and grandfathers of Erving Goffman and what I hope you'll see is how what Cooley developed and how God made refined it lead us to where the document is already taken us that's the logic of this little piece in this lecture
 Charles Horton Cooley developed
 a deceptively simple idea one that has been
 well looked askance on by a lot of psychology types sort of the opposite of autonomy but Cooley argues that we develop a sense of who we are we develop an identity based in large part of what we see from other people it's as though we see ourselves reflected even literally in the eyes of other people we the other side of this is where Goffman went with this idea with impression management we were trying to get a good look from other people but who is arguing that we really change who we are what we're about and what we do based on the feedback we get from other people
 I know when I have this room I know when you're all paying attention I can sense your I can sense a collective inquisitiveness I can also sense when I've lost you and so I will try to do things to bring you back
 or I'll keep doing more of even if I hadn't planned on it what it is that I know has grabbed you and we wait you have a sense of when you're clicking with somebody don't you whether it's at lunch with her to a job interview just being with friends or someone you love deeply you're getting feedback and for Cooley it's essentially like you're looking into their eyes as though it was a mirror
 so I'm taking a psychology class and who knows the dead white guys names of Carl Rogers and BF Skinner Rogers and Skinner to sort of ideological competitors one of another I think there's a story whether it's true or apocryphal or not it aptly illustrates this notion of the Looking-Glass self
 The Story Goes Carl Rogers and eminent sort of relational list if you will is giving a lecture public lecture and shortly after he starts Skinner his sort of perspectives competitor this is Marx and durkheim for us Rogers these behaviorist operant conditioning piano condition you to do thing sits in the back while Rogers suddenly now knows he's not only giving a public lecture he's
 sort of arguing with what he knows Skinner is saying that's crap Carl we've talked about this Etc
 so The Story Goes Like This Rogers is giving his lecture and is he moves to one side of the room out of the corner of his eye he notices Skinner's looking around scratching his head puts his pencil down if he had a phone in those days he would start texting
 and almost without cognitively realizing it as he does this kind of thing and all good lecturer is all really good lecturers do just like I do here right don't argue
 has he moved to this side of the room he sees Skinner cuz he's got his eye on him looking glass start writing things down leaning forward doing a little of this you know and The Story Goes that by the end of that lecture Skinner giving him subtle feedback like that had Rogers on this side of the room with his foot on a chair holding his ear cuz that's the only time Skinner would be paying attention to now that's called operant conditioning but it's really the Looking Glass self
 in microcosm we adjust to what other people give us in the way of feedback create a positive we can make Skinner start doing this well we'll see anyway that's the foundation for what comes later Charles Horton Cooley the Looking-Glass self we see ourselves reflected in the eyes of other people
 we get an assessment of who we are and we will even adjust our identity to get positive reinforcement
 George Herbert Mead argued that the formation of an identity begins in infancy you know we've often understood infants as being just a little Blobs of protoplasm that we take care of made argued that we interact with them and profound an interesting ways and most of his work goes up until about age 5 or 6 anyway
 and he argues that there are three stages of identity development because of the imitative stage imitative
 the play stage and the game stage
 I got a fairly lengthy piece on me and it involves a lot of stories about my relationship with my grandkids not all of which are especially at a fine so stay tuned
 I got a picture here that I want to show you that illustrates what Mead would call the imitative stage it's on her hand. She tried to kill the lights for just a second
 this is a picture of my now
 now 16 year old grandson who's playing varsity baseball this year in high school as a junior but he's about 1 ish in that picture and the woman you see on the antique display screen is my wife she is an expert in child development she's a retired elementary school guidance counselor and she knows kids better than kids no kids anyway this is a webcam shot this is before Skype before face time and all that and you see my grandson Logan interacting with the one he sort of know it was as Graham
 and if you can see I hope the lighting is okay my wife is holding your hands up in the air right in the camera and her fingers are widely spread apart so the infant's eyes can catch what she's doing now what you don't see in the picture is Logan's little bitty right hand waving back he's imitating what she's doing the only reason you don't see is cuz I didn't take the picture out of framed it better but nonetheless
 this is the imitative stage of development and it it's sort of big you know lot of
 gestures and noise and so on and then that you can use to interact
 who has an infant somewhere in their life niece nephew little brother little sister there interesting aren't they
 I have to admit to you that I bypassed Parenthood for for grandparents but I was married for a while we did not children I was not married for a while then I married this lovely woman you just saw and she had three adult kids and now we have seven grandkids so parenting is not something that I picked up but by God
 imitative stage of development this little story has the same punchline to when you've already heard before that is your professor is an idiot seriously I am loath to report to you that every single detail of the story is actually true exactly as it happened and it's embarrassing so fuck a lot
 I'm a Bible. Cuz I was also minister of the church and small Church lot of gray haired elderly people in it and one Sunday a young couple with an infant came to church church shopping
 thinking in our Sky new to the area I think about maybe having the child baptized in this is like gold for a minister in a small church and I'll go I'll go visit and 7 one evening that next week I assured into their living room and they know what staging is about there's coffee and cake and looks like the place is just been cleaned and we sit down that's a nice conversation over on a credenza in a car seat the infant is sound asleep right now backtrack what do I know about kids Logan loves clowns not literally but people Clowning Around the doorway and I had this wonderful encounter with him where I bounce up and down and then we need to look at me and laugh I would go work
 and he would laugh some more and I go I got this thing figured out no problem
 so that's my that's what I know about young kids so far so we're having this lovely conversation in this living room with the baby over there sound asleep and the baby starts to stir and I don't notice it right away but the mothers all over it like
 waking up looking around makes eye contact with me
 like who's this and I got a chance to interact with a child what do I know about positive children interaction
 eye contact with the child who has just awakened and has seen me once in her life never in this room I go
 the next sound you hear is what
 oh my gosh
 that that ended pretty much the meeting
 and I go home and I'm telling my wife this story and I'm going I thought
 she was speechless like you did what
 imitative Sage I got the kid to imitate what I did
 now
 again truth-in-advertising hear it took 14 years but as a 14 year old that infant was baptized in that church and all's well that ends well where to get over the drama
 be imitators stage gives way to kids maybe 2 ish then what made called the play stage this is the stage where from the kids point of view the axis of the earth goes right through their bodies the world was created especially for me who's got a two-year-old in your life
 am I right on this
 play with me
 play with me
 give me all of your undivided attention sure one of the things he's going to say is Papa don't come in my room and play planes
 and I'm going to go in my mind not especially but you're five and I love you and I'm going to Blink that you're not going to want anything to do with me course I will sit and play with you but more to the point this wanting attention from the people around is how we sort of learn to interact and we interact first a little tiny narcissist he would kill me if he knew I was telling these stories on them but anyway
 he did his parents before his other siblings were born came to visit us for about a four-day deal at Thanksgiving and not only in our little two-bedroom condo that we have which is buzzing with all these people we got the one kid who's like a year-and-a-half his parents that's two adult my wife and made two more adult and my stepsons sister and her husband come up from Austin so we've got six adults and a one-and-a-half-year-old for 4 days
 the kid is at the center of our universe he got all manners of attention from 6 really important people to him that loved him dearly right well goes back to Illinois goes back to daycare first day back at daycare gets a ticket I don't know if you knew you could get tickets a debt youth the daily progress report it was a ticket but we got a screenshot of this this was so funny at the bottom has Logan had a lot of attention lately you seem to Crave it really that's like the best day in the world for a kid in the play stage that's what it is
 the world was created especially for me
 which gives way to what Mead called the game stage and the game stage is where we learned that life is a game but more importantly There are rules to the game and this next story not too long after this may be a year or so Logan learned that there were rules but more importantly Logan's dad was reminded that there are rules in The Game of Life
 this was before you can play internet gaming Xbox Halo online none of that stuff Logan's dad and Logan's dad slightly younger brother love video games did then still do they each had the latest Xbox whatever that was back about 05 and
 this was before the Life part but they only live 30 miles apart so Logan's dad trucks Logan and the big Xbox to his brother's house and they're in the living room playing against each other in the house is Logan's Uncle Jason and his wife the lovely Aunt Rachel who is just dear to us she teaches middle school so she don't have kids yet so they just got this pristine house right Dad and Uncle Jason are playing video games and Logan has the run of the rest of the first floor what could go wrong with this one of these big great room places that Rachel is one of these kinds of people maybe you know that maybe got one time in your life she alphabetize as her Tupperware little bit obsessive
 well they're on the Xbox locked and loaded and Logan has the run of the first floor and there are no kid things on the kitchen cabinet so Aunt Rachel comes home from running errands on a Saturday and finds her dear nephew Logan at Age 3 hip-deep in tupperware in the kitchen
 everything stopped
 not just Logan Learning that
 rules are different of Aunt Rachel's house little bit and by the way let's all pick up stop the game that kind of deal
 all we do is interact with a set of rules we call them norms and the game stage hits us fairly early on when we learn what the rules are we also learn and this is a hard lesson to learn that the rules may be different for home and in public I'm about 5 and I learned that the world's greatest breakfast is ham and eggs and fried potatoes it just is right maybe still it and I learned from my dad but it's a regular Saturday I went dad Cooks breakfast it's a good breakfast I learned that you take the eggs over easy and put them on top of the potatoes and create a mush out of it and then dip the ham in it and so that's how I learned to eat that breakfast and I after I learned that for a while we went out to breakfast and I started to eat it that way in my mom kind of said
 we don't do that out here going really look at that
 now I think that's a stupid rule I am now out of supervision I that if you ever run into me eating breakfast at Denny's you'll see me with a pile of mush and hot sauce now not as a kid I just catch up then that's how you eat eggs it's just how you do it's the rule but I learned being confused why are there why did the rules just change well we're playing the game in a different stadium and that's just an example of how I think you know we all learn
 what the rules are the game and they are different here there and maybe other places show me the emerging self again seeking a sense of who we are where we are it's kind of what the rules are for appropriate behavior leading us of course to Goffman understood Cooley probably as well as anyting and said yeah we're going to get feedback from other people but we can
 we can give them what they need to give us positive feedback
 by being
 clever live generous polite whatever it is and you know any time you're in a job interview or maybe when you're at Thanksgiving with people you don't know very well anytime you need to make an impression
 paging dr. Kaufman all the world's a stage and we are in costume and we are reciting script you're doing exactly that now pretending to pay attention even if you're checking your email and I don't know I saw all I see are a little laptops this way
 but I understand that interactions are
 sometimes imprecise and not fully under our control so we just do the best we can and try to at least look like we're going along to getting along theoretical foundations on a micro-level Cooley meet and got questions
 so far so good
 note to self don't scream at babies if you take away nothing away from this other than that
 we talked about going to generalize for a while he talked about a single life cycle as though it were the life cycle of all and all I'm suggesting here is that there are predictable benchmarks of how we develop a sense of who we are and where that plays itself out in the world and childhood once we're out of infancy and up in school and all that we are learning from a lot of other people as well as our parents and childhood childhood is over about the time we hit puberty about the time our bodies are starting to change and things are happening to us physically and emotionally that require a little more complicated approach to life is war life is fairly simple
 play with him feed him teaching you know the basics and so on and then and then just about the time they want nothing to do with you and will ignore you in any way possible you have to teach him the really important stuff but anyway
 the issue here is that childhood ends sooner than puberty hits for a lot of kids and I got a couple of increasingly and I think the the internet social media are playing a huge role in this we're teaching kids to live in an adult World long before they're adults and actually forcing them to live in an adult World long before they're adults sometimes if you've got I don't know if it's free on Amazon Prime for free on Netflix but you might enjoy finding the movie Little Miss Sunshine anybody ever heard of it
 it's been out about 15 years but it's one of them it's one of those you know you just can't stop you can't take your eyes off of Alan Arkin the grandpa for one thing Abigail Breslin Academy Award nominee nominated adult actor is a twelve-year-old in the movie and Steve Carell is in it he's the brother this is before the office and all that anyway it's a stand-up on kids beauty pageants and the insanity of that the insanity of turning children into centerfold essentially and making them up and doing all this and
 it is worth just seeing the ending where this twelve-year-old is dancing to super freak just fast forward to that and then you get the deal
 the other image and I hadn't put this into this lecture until just yesterday the hurried child child we're pushing kids to adulthood quicker
 have you seen the Public Service Announcement by the nonprofit that emerged after the Sandy Hook killings and 27 kids got slaughtered in the Ramona Elementary School if you seen the PSI on that the public service announcement
 it just came out within the last 2 or 3 days just Google it and look at it
 but be preparing it's basically it's a it's a video of the first day of school things I think I'm taking my pencil and scissors which I might have to use as a weapon my skateboard I know how to ride a skateboard and I can use it to Bosch auto window
 the hurried child entering an adult world that has it has changed in the last 20 years or so so that you might want to just stick to Childhood beauty pageants they're a lot more amusing than Sandy Hook PSA is but nonetheless
 adolescence is this sort of
 one for here once but they're kind of thing where you know you're expected you're more grown-up than that now act like a grown-up and then we had second you can't do that you're not old enough to do that it's like one foot in each of two world who would go back to being 14 right now if you could
 wait a minute wasn't horrible but you know the glasses kind of thing and you know it's hard to leave childhood behind but it's hard to know when I'm going to have one shot on adolescents in microcosm this refers to my stepson Jason who's Andrews who's Logan's Uncle a year ago we were up in Illinois we will all went out to dinner or not to dinner and Katie who's 12 at that point in 12 holy cow
 you know and she's playing a video game and the word comes down we're leaving for you got 10 minutes later Katie's locked bedroom door opens and how she comes in full battle array she's got her best little black dress on full makeup hair done and we're going to dinner and her mother goes you're not going to dinner like that go put your put your jeans back on well then we hit the tornado 12 started to rev up and finally Uncle Jason steps in a ghost let's not fight this it's all right let's go let's just go and menus come in and the kid menus come out and her nine-year-old sister gets the kid menu with the crayon and all that
 Katie said I'm not one of those
 coloring the kid menu That's adolescence
 what
 and she would literally pitch a fit if she knew I told you that story
 but it's hard to tell you also one more thing here if you love being 14 a lot of you did you're going to really love being 40 cuz it's the same story
 where the kids go I just got used to having them around I just I just started to understand no hormones or whatever
 and the dogs Dad what
 who's got parents in there or 4:40 ish or above a little bit and are sort of looking around their world like the hell just happened because you laughed or something like that be gentle
 you can look forward to it someday and I'll and the best of all worlds they they feel emotionally just like you did when you were 14 so if that gives you any empathy you know just take a breath and go all right I'll just be over here when you want me know that kind of thing
 these in-between stages are olestra to
 it's where we experience what I would call anticipatory socialization I know that's not on the outline but right next to adolescence right anticipatory socialization is where we start rehearsing for being really autonomous in the world all of you are living someplace other or not all of you but most of your living someplace other than under a roof provided by a parent a dorm and apartment some such thing and if it's a relations for dorm life that are different than regulations are non regulations and apartment life
 you may have a credit card but it's got a very strict limit on it probably get credit cards because Bell Maxim out quickly and their parents will pay them off because nobody wants the credit yet and then you start to learn you actually have to at the end of the month for that thing I got for free at Best Buy right they didn't I didn't have to spend anything I just handed them this little card it was like checking your ID right and did you know $100 pair of tennis shoes if you pay the minimum or take cute five or six years to pay off they love that
 trying to work this out
 we learn to do adult like things in increments that's what anticipatory socialization is all about lecture
 adulthood also has its own set of stages of adulthood is going to hit you smack in the face if you are 18 now in about five or six years you're going to look around and going once again Toto we're not in Kansas anymore I just sign the mortgage on this thing got a brand new set of car payment student loans are starting to come do your pregnant what
 suddenly we don't have near as many inner ear infections as we used to have from college right
 yeah you're settling in and then you spend the next 10 or 15 years refining that worldview and making it work
 and then you all go off to college and then wait a second I got to get through midlife that things are kind of nice having more money than we have the season football tickets in the guy that was next to us was that way for 45 years while the kids were in college and the year has last one graduated he said I just got a $25,000 a year raise
 awesome
 and you do you know that that's our lower the income is higher the responsibilities and you know you can go out to dinner more travel a little bit and then one day it will hit you and you won't even be thinking about this you'll be just doing a Mindless Google search ever do that I mean just start googling and then like in 10 minutes ago how did I get to Madagascar or whatever the heck it is
 it will hit you out of the blue
 you have lived more days then you're going to
 .
 half-time is over
 crap
 and then
 in the best of all worlds you will get a Medicare card I just got one of those this year you don't get those to your 65 and you go that's cool wait a minute
 this is the fourth quarter
 and not just the first minute of the fourth quarter thanks
 there's a lot of good being being this in the stage one of the good things is that you are forced to say to yourself what really is important anymore in on how much self-inflicted hassle do I need
 and how much of the time can I say you know I would rather focus on relationships than details you don't have to be 65 with a Medicare card smacking you in the face to at least entertain the idea that self-inflicted hassles are not worth it and maybe you got more time for the people who care about you and if you don't come to that conclusion now you will when you understand that you've lost a few of them and
 for too long so I'm going to lose you and you want to just want to make sure you got that that connection little more strongly baby than you've been needed before but it also has its own set of five stages of development
 all I'm doing with the second piece in this lecture is suggesting that there are sort of predictable benchmarks events emotions and circumstances
 no more less Universal I mean different than detail certainly but are more or less Universal
 a question or comment will get through this last segment
 who does this to us who turns us into civil social creatures do a whole hour and 20-minute lecture that I have on family and segment for introduced the idea that families teach us to foundational things they teach us the rules socialization thing they teach you how to eat eggs in public wash behind are yours etc etc just the beginning of gender role expectations we begin to learn that there are differences between not just male and female but masculine and feminine
 and we learned them in very subtle ways that I am guilty of this I am I am sometimes horrifyingly guilty of this and I catch myself at it I can't stop because I think these are wired in in ways that sometimes catch up with us
 invariably is my grandsons were growing up and I would I don't see them all that often the youngest one lives in Austin and the other to live in in Illinois
 and especially if they were younger when we would see them and I would go on I don't Slugger
 sweater
 or my granddaughter's what's up
 and the girls are going
 I mean
 I know more about this kind of stuff than almost anybody any other category of people and I still get trapped
 into the gender thing and the and the girls are going I hate being a snickerdoodle
 list some times and guys might be going on slug all the time
 Etc
 but that's where it begins and schools and this is the point here on the school 10 to reinforce this schools do not make us more gender egalitarian they've sort of reinforced Slugger and Snickerdoodle a little bit
 there is research on this and I'm going to go straight to research by doing a sort of mine skit here imagine I don't know what's called a 3rd grade arithmetic lesson and the teacher goes what is 6 * 9 and Johnny Goes 54
 and the teacher says that's right Johnny 954 who knows what is 11 * 20 and Susie goes to 20
 and the teacher goes right Susie good job but please wait to be called
 so Susie gets
 told she did it right with an asterisk Susie gets rebuked for being aggressive while Johnny gets rewarded for being assertive and the behavior is exactly the same
 get the idea
 Slugger and Snickerdoodle right there in the room going I get that
 it's a it's a struggle at least we're talking about at least we're talking about it
 so that's part of the issue and you know it doesn't get a lot better look at the athletic budgets for the women's volleyball team versus Etc get the idea and not Title Nine is trying to correct that but
 football does cost a lot as it were
 family school where am I
 no. Got a fairly lengthy digression here to take you places you never been before computers it's where we experienced some anticipatory socialization who in here has ever done something in a peer group that your parents would have disapproved I guess they were watching everybody thank you
 it's where we miss where we start learning adult things and
 forgive me peers are not the most helpful supervisors of doing adult things for the first time right
 how many of you noticed that even though it's technically illegal a lot of college students that you know drink booze like idiots anybody ever noticed this I thought of course for a long time called alcohol drugs and society and there's a lot of reasons why I'm not teaching that particular course at the moment but one of the questions I posed rhetorically in that class was why do some college students just drink like it is
 here's the answer
 no one's taught them how not to drink like idiots we have no way of teaching moderate alcohol use we forbid it until 21 and then go have at it
 does that make any sense well if I don't know what let's leave the drinking thing aside for a second and examined to other
 analogous dangerous things that we grow into under some supervision who's got a driver's license did you just walk into the store and buy that no you took driver's ed
 you passed the test written test to pass a proficiency test your Serpentine didn't have to parallel park to pass a driving test
 you may never have to parallel park again but at least you know how
 cheap asses proficiency test and we license you
 to the privilege of operating a motor vehicle which is a big hunk and dangerous machine it'll go a hundred twenty miles an hour it's full of explosives
 people died doing this
 some people will try to reduce the number of people that died doing this by at least schooling you up giving you some practice and monitoring the crap out of how you drive with
 speed limits in traffic lights in police surveillance and so on we know how to teach adolescents to do a dangerous thing at least safer than if we just said here's the keys figure it out right I mean I would be insane
 let's put an F-150 pickup truck right here going to take a little more room next to it
 is that a vaguely dangerous thing
 who at 8:12 ish
 Safeway operated one of those things we don't have to do that whether it's hunter safety class or at your Uncle Frank
 I mean real one don't point that thing ever at anything you don't intend to kill rule to through rule thousand 01 end of story and then you practice with hunter safety you get hunting licenses
 so we have an F-150 that you can drive after being trained and licensed we have a 30 ought 6 that at least partially you can operate after having been trained supervised and licensed and over here we got a 12 pack of Bud Light
 now if for which there is a strict prohibition against its use until your age 21 if you were from Mars and you knew nothing else except the training for and the availability of a pickup truck a deer rifle and a 12 pack of beer you would guess that this is the most dangerous substance of the three
 we have no way that we do not have we have not institutionalized a way to teach safe moderate drinking we prohibited until 21 and then he is a good idea let's have 21 shots on a 21st birthday
 the Bible says alcohol gladdens the heart which it does a drink or two
 with someone you love over a wonderful dinner
 21 shots on your 21st birthday will stop your heart I mean literally
 you will pass out throw up and choked to death
 there's a good idea
 or
 maybe short of that
 you will sneak alcohol while trying to safely operate the car you've been taught to operate safely and you may not even realize that after one or two drinks your judgment is impaired whether you're legally drunk or not
 I bet I can beat that train
 who's got a memorial page in your high school yearbook
 for whom is this for how many views is story behind that memorial page alcohol-related
 duh kids die because we do not have a way to teach them how not to drink either foolishly in and of itself or to foolishly drink while doing something else like driving a car
 I propose drink School driver's ed hunter safety drink school now I know that physiologically alcohol and developing bodies and brains
 is not without its risk I also know that alcohol consumed in vigorous excess episodically is of greater risk
 when we were doing all this student survey research work on tattoos and drinking and other things one of our site one of our subjects sites with Pepperdine University universities in Malibu California cuz when I drew up the design of This research project if they're going to pay me to go to colleges I'm going to Malibu God would retire in Malibu California that's right
 Pepperdine is a Church of Christ school is very conservative drinking is not allowed on campus it is not allowed Pepperdine students are not allowed to drink off-campus whether there at 8 or not and if they're in the presence of people are drinking off campus they are to leave and if that's a Pepperdine student there to rat them out
 that's some serious drinking rules right one of the reasons we got to survey students at Pepperdine is one of my doctoral student one of my grad school buddies is Dean of international students there nice guy helped us get Entre Tus To every student at Pepperdine it's a small school does an international experience they go abroad Pepperdine itself has five campuses World white ones and China wants to know when is I think in sub-Saharan Africa once in Italy and Italy has a wonderful place to visit in part because I got wonderful food and really good wine
 well underage Pepperdine students who aren't supposed to drink it all anyway in the orientation to your Italian overseas experience includes my friend the date of international Affairs saying you know what going to be the host family and especially early in this trip they're going to sit you down to a really nice dinner and because of who they are they're going to express how glad they are to see you by offering you a glass of wine and I know what the rules are around here when they do that drink it toast with him drink it slowly learn how they do this
 I think it's a good idea I propose this for drinks school I propose at age 18 but he's into this I know it's 16 we can learn to drive but maybe we used to this nobody's at churches are empty on Saturday afternoon nobody goes to church and he does anything we got lots of room for classrooms we got a parking lot that's empty what a great idea let's have some experience learn about learn about the risks of alcohol use on developing brain learn about the benefits of it gladdening the heart and to what limit
 Trump to let's go to the parking lot get you on a tricycle and run the serpentine that would be interesting
 I would do that I would also drink this one glass of wine over the course of the next hour
 get on the tricycle Tri the serpentine is it different stuff like that
 after you know 6 weeks is that
 I would say you're eligible to pass a written test and be licensed
 to consume legally let's just say beer and wine for now at age 18 what we do for people who are taking away for X number of periods of time and so on I would say you could get you could get your drinking license suspended maybe in Definitely Maybe until you're 25
 41 drunk-and-disorderly for one driving while impaired and not only will we suspend your drinking license till you're 25 will suspend your driver's license to
 I think that could fly I think
 I think we have
 we might have a couple fewer your birthday jizz if we somehow someway took some of the Mystique
 out of alcohol consumption and acknowledged dangerous but there are ways to make it to use safer to people of a certain age and of a certain ability to comprehend these complex fats right and hunting and I think you can get into a lot more deadly trouble a lot more quickly with a pickup truck in a fuel rifle than you can with a bottle of wine I mean I'm not suggesting that it's totally benign but
 after analyzing culture for 25 years I asked myself what do we already know how to do and how we doing that in the same way help this and it goes to one of the fundamental things I keep in my head I actually have one favorite Bible verse
 Hezekiah 3:16 let not the ideal be the enemy of the good
 so you're going
 I don't think I've ever read that
 you haven't there is no book of Hezekiah but there should be in that verse out of the in there ideally.
 be so easily Troublesome but we can make them less Troublesome and make weekend short of Ideal we can make things better and I think that that's one of the models I have just in my own okay ideally around here etc etc but we can incrementally make it some better let not the ideal be the enemy of the good and I think that's something that we can we are did we already put that into play when we talked about what kids do in peer groups
 okay that's enough of that
 comment
 I'm I drink school ID or anything else for that matter
 is anybody even remotely saying to yourself drink school I wonder
 good thanks I know that the impediment to drink school is organized religion I mean seriously it is and I think that that's a tough one because there are reasons learning faithful decent people that regard the activity of sinful and there's certainly an element of risk to it whether it's in or not I don't know and yet there are also decent reasonable faithful God loving people loving people that regarded as
 did I was Central to the good life and I think that when two sets of equal a religious people feel so differently about something it's a tougher cell there doesn't seem to be the level of moral risk with driving a car or even with hunting to some extent although not completely you can leave here and think about drink school for an hour or two and you leave and mission accomplished
 the big question with media and this is another tough one is to what extent does listening to music watching movies playing video games reading Facebook
 prettiest dangerous Behavior
 Twitter made me in the end of the world as we know it because it legitimates the validity of the Sound by if it's on Twitter it must be true
 and the sound bite I'm going wait a second hold on a minute you need more than a day doubled it then they can you watch working at 280 characters now or something like that it's not enough
 kids who shoot up schools have been watching too many violent movies are playing too many video games we need to put a Walmart stop advertising video games after the after the shooting in stop selling video games
 in my world of looking at the relationship between social realities religion and health
 crime in education stuff like that it is extraordinary really difficult to prove or demonstrate causation one thing causes this causation is very hard. We can look at associations and wonder about them among the earliest of the truly prominent school shootings was Columbine High School Littleton Colorado 1998 two guys Klebold and Harris were their last names were clearly understood to have done a lot of violent video gaming and embracing what would call The Goth culture well that's why they shot up the school maybe one of a thousand Reasons
 I'm more prominent reason was they organize those thoughts and ideas together the influence of media I think to the extended exist at all is mediated
 through the interpretation of that media with other people let's go watch a movie what did that mean to you etcetera etcetera etcetera
 no one thing causes any other one thing
 and you can't get any more complicated than that if all you do is use Twitter
 if that's dangerous
 it leads us to
 scapegoating
 and pretending that we can actually make a difference by doing one small thing we can do a lot of small things that may make it less bad
 even if ideally we'd like to do more things that we can't quite get done yet
 the whole story of I got a whole segment on this in the next lecture so buckle up the whole piece on on guns and gun violence and media as well as all manners of other things and media is complicated
 and very difficult to sort out
 I would not say that there is no connection between violent medium a violent medium and a violent Act
 but it's sort of like a plane crash if you read the debrief of any
 Aviation disaster it's never one thing it's like four or five things had to line up at exactly the same time in exactly the wrong way any one of which would have derailed
 it's in park pilot air it's in part weather Etc it's never just went by the way something broke it just the wrong time
 it's never one thing and anybody that would tell you it's just one thing and we could solve it if we just do that
 is I think selling you something for their own benefit and I think you should be skeptical of that and say wait a second maybe it may be more complicated
 then what you just said and a whole relationship between media and violence certainly falls into that category it's more complicated than I think most people will tell you
 and it makes us feel better if we can just Blame Halo or something like that
 the workplace is also a place we learned to be civil and social it's where we learn in a more prominent way the stuff we're already learning in college like you need to show up on time you need to do the work that was assigned and there are penalties if you don't and I don't know if any college class has a penalty for being tardy but there are absence penalty and the consequence of let's say my favorite euphemism these days an inner ear infection in college
 you show up later you miss class are you blow off an assignment or you just are you just slapped a shit in a car payment in a kid on the way and you show up with an inner ear infection and miss a meeting or show up without your report but the boss was kind of the consequences will be greater so we're learning about what we have ahead of us now so that we can do a more credible job of being who we want to be embracing that identity once we get that job where we're hoping for and that's why I have an attendance policy
 and
 having some consequence for you not being here really runs against a lot of what I believe in that is if I I mean I really want to treat you like adults so why would I slap your hand for four points if you're not here that seems childish in juvenile it is and if you don't want to be here I'd rather you weren't anyway
 on the other hand and this is love this is a pretty big other hands for me I think that and I told you this on the first day and I just want to repeat it whatever your attendance score is that mean you're going to get 4 points for 5 days worth of attendance and you just don't know what those days are unless I tell you in advance like I did last week
 that means you get 7917 excused absences that won't cost you anything except you know missing out on a great level of entertainment that's been riveting you for the last hour and 10 minutes Etc
 but I think it really is
 a sign of your becoming Adept at just doing what you agreed to do that's the most important life skill I think you can get out of college agreeing to do something and then stunningly simply doing it
 within the amount of time that is allotted for the amount of effort that was required at the deadline that was set out in advance just develop a work ethic
 and a grad student here four years ago who I didn't direct your thesis but I taught her class and she was my ta and she a real interesting thesis although it wasn't the best written thesis I've ever seen she was not lights out the brightest grad student I've ever had all she was plenty bright
 but the one thing she had going for a with said she had to work ethic that wouldn't quit and she was writing about an interested in a topic that maybe one of America's best medical sociologist who happened to be a guy I work with a Purdue who I wrote an article with Ken Ferraro I thought she'd fit right into his program a lot of money and she was interested in what he wanted to do and if all she did was apply to Purdue University she would make it out of the pile your GRE score wasn't that high but I called Ken Ferraro and I know I know I've known him for 25 years and I said you know no one is going to outwork this woman
 no one is going to outwork her and that's all I can say to sort of Tiffany said well I saw her application and I took note of her interest but basically because you said so I'll give her a shot and nobody got work then that that student she got her PhD in good order she landed a postdoctoral fellowship at a place where she's studying with a Hall of Famer in publishing like crazy and you're going to hear her name in five years if you pay attention to Medical sociology she's going to be out there out front when they got in the door but that was just she was lucky enough to be in a position where what she was able to do well
 paid off in in a big way so I think if you imagine people writing letters of recommendation for you because of your work in college while because of your work at work and you want to take it you want to get another job or secret promotion
 see if you can't imagine somebody in your life at that point being able to write a letter on your behalf say nobody will outwork you and I don't even necessarily mean work From Dawn till Dusk I mean just do the work as well as people who do this can try to do and that will see you through that's why I have an attendance policy it's just a little example in a little sign of sort of anticipatory socialization in the workplace
 traffic Church does it to
 church teaches Conformity to the extent that there are rules about the status of the other thing and the government chooses to pay churches and nonprofits to get that done through tax breaks we believe that we're all better off if enough of us Embrace a religious ideology that it keeps us civil and social as it were not very coarse darkseid's to religion there are you know there are ways in which religion stigmatizes creates out-groups even legitimate violence and they're certainly an upside and a downside to that but in general terms
 organizing around Faith principles are generally similar to ethics principles taxes it's why they don't pay income tax on the money in the play or that's donated in a charitable way and why don't pay sales tax on the stuff they buy identity happens in rooms identity is generated in our heads based in part about what we learned from other people about us in rooms it is a eminently micro-level source of
 source of Our Lives
 key pieces of who we are questions
 wish I had a better punchline have a good weekend see you Tuesday
