good morning everybody theme music here about three songs by Joe Ely and is a group The Flatlanders one was called Homeland Refugee the other call oh and it's called right where I belong and this last one Whimsical little ballad tonight I think I'm going to go downtown all about community population community the second of three lectures in this last segment will have a piece on social change on Tuesday one of these next today or Tuesday will be a great day for points left to get and with that in mind you already have what works out to be kind of a provisional total for your course work here on which the grade will be based
for some of you it means you've earned the score you want or for some of you it made me and you've earned the grade that you can get because you can't approve the final can only help you it can't hurt you by taking it
you can use the final to replace your heretofore lowest grade so or lowest score so for example if you have 240 and your lowest score is 40 and you need to 43 to earn an a which is the cut point on points you need to 43 on the final it's that simple are there any questions about how that works
it's it's really you don't people want to try to figure out their average and and it gets a little complicated when you do that the final exam for this class is Friday of finals week first day of play finals week 7:30 in the morning so you get this one out of the way first right out of the box David will try to run a review and I think his chances doing this a pretty high in this room at 11 on dead day we are not allowed to schedule rooms on dead day
but he will there be any the rooms are not in high demand on dead day that's why they call it that and he will have access to this room even through my ID in case his doesn't work so and if not he's got to work around built-in where you can send you some stuff so if you want to review for the final come here at 11 on Thursday the 6th and there is I would a 95 + percent chance he'll be able to do that and if not he's got another work around okay
again any other questions
but anything
Collective Behavior population community and social change their the last three topics of most introduction of Sociology courses they they include a lot of ideas that we talked about before and their topics that are somewhat more you know contemporarily relevant I guess and we all live in communities we are all parts of a population so I want to talk about what that is a little bit and then talk about the specific nature of urban Suburban
Lubbock and Rural communities a little bit so what we mean by
a number of people just a collection of people who
share some living space
who are drawn together for some reason
I suppose in one sense
this class is a kind of community we're in a particular place at a particular time we have a purpose but more accurately I think a dorm floor
is a community a neighborhood is a community small town are divided into communities New York Chicago San Francisco have neighborhoods that are actually referred to for example as Little Italy or Chinatown or Greek Town and that has to do with sort of where where people settle in to see neighborhood in Chicago where the first church where I had some field at work to do it was in the Andersonville neighborhood in the city of Chicago now it's not Greektown Chinatown Little Italy or such but where do you suppose the people who settled that neighborhood had their ancestors come from Andersonville anybody got to guess
you missed the lecture in geography on Scandinavia Sweden Finland Norway Denmark
and the church was around the corner from this tiny little killer breakfast place it was it Swedish restaurant that you could get Swedish pancakes which are different than Denny's pancakes and they top them with lingonberries and if you don't know what a lingonberry is well look it up and on the map that's what it says
but it's completely been resettled by Laotian and Vietnamese another Southeast Asian refugees immigrants and so on killer stir fry but no more lingonberries unless it's still this community as it were it's a place Community Central is a place where who we are individually gets connected to another identity of collective identity
we talked about elements of demography what is it that demographers study
these are all quality of life indicators so population involves demography Community involves studying people and Collective identity that's what we're about today
fertility and mortality infant mortality in migration are both quality of life indicators and they are what creates or slows down population growth population growth of birth in a population how many live births occur per thousand in a population and christamore live births you have the more growth you have
mortality obviously they're obviously incidence of death how many people are lost in a population on a given year per thousand
because of death and
the interesting feature about the relationship between fertility and mortality is how they differ depending on the type of country where would you guess fertility rates would be higher in developed countries like the US and Canada and Switzerland and Norway Orion underdeveloped countries of sub-Saharan Africa some places in South America Central America is higher the developed world the developing World correct largely because in the developing world life expectancy isn't Islam
people don't live as long and as a percentage of the whole there are more women of childbearing age in developing countries
because the old guys in the elderly have died off infertility is dependent completely
on the percentage of relative proportion of women in a population that are of childbearing age 15 to 50 right
so the developing world has higher fertility rates
that is more people are being born proportionately and places that can least afford it that sets up some interesting Dynamics mortality rates
and in the developed world let's use the u.s. is an example fertility and mortality rates kind of cancel each other out in the US over the last 25 years or so our population has been growing but rather slowly and steadily even though fertility and mortality kind of cancel each other out they've been growing the u.s. population growing steadily from roughly 240 million to 320 million or so in the last 25 years migration and I know I've skipped infant mortality I got a piece on that in a minute migration simply means the number of people that move in versus number people move out so if you just do a little arithmetic you know the fertility rate you know the mortality rate you know that migration rate you got a sense of what population growth is about
and then the you ask slow steady growth largely due to the effects of migration over the last 25 years or so
no migration
I mean that's a reality on a collective level but country has experienced either in-migration or out-migration and the US experience is a lot of in-migration demographers call this the result of pull factors there are pull factors in the US that draw people from other countries trying to make a better life a safer life a place where their children are more likely to survive etc etc
they're cut typically coming from countries that have high push factors unstable governments Shadow governments of gangs perpetrating violence and so on and there is a living breathing Vivid laboratory for this on the US Mexico border between Tijuana and San Diego right now pull factors are drawing
push factors are producing that Caravan and there's attention on what is appropriate and reasonable that's a political issue the demographic is the reality that the u.s. is a place people want to come to and there are lots and lots and lots of places on planet Earth where people want to leave and largely for reasons
Ark survival there's a psychological concept that is in the background of a lot of what I'm going to talk about today it's called Maslow's hierarchy of needs and it's usually portrayed in the textbook says like a pyramid and then the bottom the most basic need that humans have is survival and then there are other stages up along the way and at the top is self actualization that's I am who I want to be in where I want to be who I am essentially I am self actualized impossible if you don't solve the problem and then the intermediate steps in that too and there a lot of people that live their entire lives with one job and that is to stay alive for that day and then you know there are other things that come in as a bonus to that if you can get that that's kind of the backdrop for a lot of what I'm going to be talking about today
so in any case
I think what you are seeing any time any category or group or visible number of people seek entry into another country there started at the survival level in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and then it very quickly becomes an economic issue and by and large a political issue as well for is the leading indicator of quality of life how good is any country how functional is any society that keeping born alive infant alive for 1 year that seems like job1 essentially
and you know it has a lot to do with
the availability of food and clean water and medical care and so on so and in the developing in the developed world it's fairly fairly low infant mortality and among developed countries the US has sort of in the middle we kind of get a C+ on infant mortality compared to the rest of the developed world but hey degrees right
in the developing World infant mortality is sort of the basis for survival in some ways how do we keep enough people alive
to move forward and become more developed if you will all right those are just elements of demography demography is the study of population fair enough
a little philosophy I guess and again the hierarchy of needs peace comes into play here
poverty is defined
differently in different places and in different ways poverty in the US actually has a mathematical e line of household income it's in the neighborhood of 25 or so thousand a year below which families wear that level of income is what they're about makes you eligible public assistance to try to obviate the effects of poor nutrition for substandard housing
if you're from a big city you know where the areas are the people struggle with this to try to get it a meal for its for their kids and to try to keep problems from occurring inside the difficult home sweater that involves animals rodents and so on or neighbors and other people wanting to do them harm for some reason
that's how we Define poverty in the US substandard housing and malnutrition worldwide more simply who's starving who's homeless
who's starving who's Homeland and there's this
little thing I put on my website attacks on the front page it's not on the Introduction to Sociology page because I think it's
even more dramatic than that let me show you about this
a little thing down here buried but no up beneath the library called world wealth calculator and it's just a website that's hopefully going to pop right up here
it will tell you how much money it takes
compared to the rest of the world to live well not listen imagine for a minute that you get a four-year degree from here in your twenties 2 or 3 years old and you get the job you want in the Metroplex how much money does that job pay how much would you be saying you know what fair amount of money for the fair work I'll give them how much
65000 what's a you get that job
can you have a $65,000 a year job
if you compare yourself worldwide you are among the wealthiest 1.2% of the people in the world 98.7% of the rest of the world is less well-off than you with a reasonable for your degree job that amazing
who thinks that by midlife you'd like to earn a hundred grand
I'd be a good salary
at a hundred grand 99.7% of the people make less than you meant something it was a piece of came out a couple of years ago that took a look at just the 65 wealthiest individuals on planet Earth we could put them in this half of the room fairly easily just sitting right here those 65 people
control half the world's wealth
an amazing 65 people half the world lives less well as it were
property of Life worldwide poverty and homelessness
which is to say
and I don't mean to overstate this that anybody who's in a classroom in an American University has sort of hit Lottery odds with life chances
a lot of it has to do with where you were born you know I would have a very different agenda in my world today if I woke up to gunfire in Honduras and my children were hiding under the bed that would be a very different agenda for how I would what I would do with the rest of my day and that's what I'm pointing at
am I saying this is not to make anyone here feel guilty or do I feel guilty about this particularly myself the point in these perspectives on how we Define poverty and so on is too perhaps Inspire us a spirit of generosity out of gratitude you know I'm lucky I'm lucky to be here lucky to have what I have even if it isn't all that much sometimes but a spirit of generosity I think is what is what will heal our ills about getting through homiletical about it that's a sermon to preach for a while so sometimes I lapsed into my old ways
Food Supplies and interesting idea let's pretend you're from Mars and you got some really good scanners on your spaceship
and you are well you're looking at this Blue Marble named Hearth you can run a scan of the planet and it will tell you how many
two-legged hominid creatures there are people on the Earth
six seven billion or so
you can also run another scan and determine how much edible food there is what's the caloric content of what's available to eat on planet Earth grain fruit vegetable protein cattle all of that
then it's simple arithmetic you know how many calories are available per person on Earth and you've read what the caloric requirement is for a healthy nutritional diet for a human being get the idea simple arithmetic and answer the question is there enough food on the earth to feed the people that live there
and the answer is a resounding yes but plenty of food so then I didn't know that now I got another question
funny food joke around
the politics of food distribution
the u.s. is a very well developed
highly
well stock is a phrase I was looking for refrigerators and and fields are well stocked with food and least ship surplus food all over the world
a lot of it lies dormant for a while on loading docks and seashores until those who run the country maybe it's a frightened oligarchy trying to stand power distributed in ways that benefit them that is if there is a developing country run by an unstable government the one thing they want to do is survive and the one thing they try to do to keep surviving is to prevent the populace from storming the palace and throwing them out one way to do that is to reduce the amount of energy they might have should that become a good idea that is keep the food away
starve them into
into compliance that sounds mercenary it sounds cruel and that's how a lot of people live
so that's the reason that a planet
who's ecology has enough food to feed us all has people who are starving and because for the most part people in American universities especially the people that work here and make Professor salaries are nowhere near starving
it's useful to know that because it does especially around the holidays perhaps Inspire the spirit of generosity I mean you can't you can't make it better by dumping five bucks in the Salvation Army kettle
but you know let not the ideal be the enemy of the good
that's my favorite Bible verse I told you that
my favorite Bible verse Hezekiah 3:16
but not the ideal be the enemy of the good
can't make it perfect but we can make it a little better Hezekiah three svet actually is not even in the Bible but it should be there's no book of Hezekiah sounds like
so yeah you can tell if people want to sign up for class next semester your sociology Professor is so full of himself he thinks something in the Bible that he thought that he thinks something he thought I should be in the Bible
actually I didn't think of it myself it's a sentiment from Greek philosophy and it's a good motto to live by cuz you can't make it perfect at least take a step forward and try to make it a little better
natural resources whose are those by the way you know is this great story
human acts is complaining to God that he or she can do anything God can do by just building it in the way God built it and God said okay show me so I take this dirt and I'm going to build a and got those hold on a second get your own dirt
okay who is dirty
whose plants are they
my anthropology colleagues Define war war war as benign way scarce resources
and resources are not scarce General either scarce
geographically
we certainly have plenty of other natural resources boil water
I just thought I met those lectures around kind of making crap up as I go along occasionally cuz it's these are the concepts it have me thinking sort of philosophically theologically and so on
if I were God and I knew that clean freshwater was the essence of our lives our bodies are literally 75 or so percent water why would I make virtually all the water on Earth undrinkable
maybe they make us more creative maybe to make us more willing to share it 25 or so percent of the world's freshwater is in the Great Lakes in the US
that is a wonderful blessing honestly I did a little thing in a church service one time when I went to Lake Meredith which is the third of three basic water supply sources for the City of Lubbock it's up north of Amarillo
and it started the backup of The Back-up Plan if we get dry enough that we need water I had no idea that a city like Lubbock needed to have such an incredibly complicated way to get water I grew up on the shores of Lake Michigan with real terms means the fresh water supply is infinity and that's a mindset that changes when you move to the panhandle of Texas and that was enough you know to get me thinking about whose water is it
you know and if you live on the shores of Lake Michigan you may have an obligation to support the infrastructure that enables it to be shared and maybe not flush your toilets directly into it as it were
that kind of competition for scarce resources compete for
is one option go towards to get it or maybe share from and some cents and how much extra do we need how many extra
you know Bush barrels of oil or bushels of grain do we need how many extra nuclear weapons do we need and whose energy is that
okay I'm going to get philosophical for another 45 seconds and then I'll move on to the stuff it'll be on the test just hold on
all energy
originates as sunlight all energy originates as sunlight
if oil is the remnants of dead dinosaurs Etc get the idea
and who is sunlight is it
was intrigued as a kid to realize that it takes about 8 minutes for sunlight to get here Sons 93 million miles away the sun could instantly disintegrate and we wouldn't know it for 8 minutes and we were just blissfully gone a lot and then all the sudden
all matter is conserved
was my last philosophical piece you should look this up you should look at the Michael Collins Earth photo Michael Collins Earth photo Michael Collins was the third astronaut along with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin who were the first to go on the moon Aldrin and Armstrong got to walk on the Moon Collins
was the Uber driver circling the moon until they went into Dilly wouldn't pick them back up until we let you know which meant that's part of his time Michael Collins was the first person to be where no one ever was and that's not on the surface of the Earth but not only were no one ever what where no one had ever seen you know the moon rotates around the Earth but the means by that creates the reality that the backside of the moon is never visible to anyone standing on Earth you cannot see the backside of the moon ever my Collins saw it first person to ever see the backside of the Moon with out of his window saw the moonscape you know like that and he saw the Earth directly in the background and it's This Magnificent photograph of the surface of the Moon with the Earth right there
and what that means biologically but I think we're going to be more important philosophically in that picture when it was taken and still today there's not a human being or any living thing that is not in the frame of that picture
except Michael Collins
is the only living being that is not still in the frame of that picture because if you count the conservation of matter when bodies when living things become deceased bodies their matter is conserved Etc all matter all DNA is conserved it's a physics concept
there's will there's a photograph that everyone and everything that the Bible and every other philosophical book talks about that was created or generated or made or destroyed is in that picture except the guy that took it thanks Mike that's a pretty cool picture you should look that up
and it gives some perspective
two natural resources the food supply and how we Define poverty who is dirt is it
this is all of ours I want more of it why
cuz I can be call a philosopher about that let's talk about morality now
can you only get to talk about morality after you get the survival pee stick and carrot
set too much
I don't know
I tell you it was worse at 9:30 so this is a lecture that's going up it doesn't matter how it goes from here
let's talk about communities for a minute we talked about what a community was that I started off on the wrong foot I was trying to find population at Community my head and that's what I went with the Andersonville stuff just a consult contain social unit where people
get her act together and take care of each other sexually a dorm floor an apartment complex a neighborhood and so on
gentrification is an interesting concept it's the resettlement of low-income areas by prosperous business and Commercial entities
it's a long word to gentrify something is to remake it in some way and there is a gentrification laboratory immediately east of the Texas Tech campus in the area east of the campus he sent really think of this box for a second this Geographic 52 University Avenue on the West 4th Street and 19th Street heading east and Avenue Q bounding it on the on the East Coast think of that box for a second
when I clean it 25 years ago that was by and large low low quality low income rent houses of small apartment buildings that kind of thing student ghetto was in part with a lot of other people that you know that was the best they could afford it was you know almost all rental property and landlords doing what landlords do that is try to get as much money out of people that don't have much of it well Jennifer keishin is not a new idea it's been going on for a long time downtown Denver where
the Colorado Rockies stadium is and all manners of other
Fern bars and restaurants and Starbucks and all the cool things that make living in a city pool are all part of that and that's what happened in what was called North Overton that and I think it's still probably is called that on on the maps I call it McDougal Bill the McDougall Corporation basically bought that whole plot of land that they had a lot to start with I got a lot of investors to do it
they bought that whole parcel of land that sort of square between University Q 4th and 19th and so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy it they bought the buildings from landlords who said to their residents I'll give you $2,000 to move you gotta move Etc that's how trickle down then they spend even more basic cost money too so they bought it destroyed it and then sold the land to developers who then rebuilt it and what we have now are the Overton Hotel lots of nice apartments and condos and I think by last count 73 Starbucks I think that's what that's what's there
the value of the land is vastly higher the tax money that the city gets which is based on the value of the land is vastly higher
nobody that was living there 25 years ago is living there now the question is gentrification really solves a lot of urban problems
it generates far more Commerce tax revenue and so on and every time you solve a problem you do create others however so the other side of gentrification is these people go they got $2,000 to leave their apartments and maybe you can start up a new place and maybe you can imagine that that's where that I just told you about and tip it to the South
that's where the people went creating a very competitive market for already cheap housing the only effective that was to make the cheap housing more expensive not different and neighborhood be turned over a lot people can afford it for a while and then
then they become homeless and homelessness is the backside of gentrification that's what happened cuz the people that we're living that the place I got gentrified sunken resettle and some cannot
if you if you stand at the front door of Lubbock High and look straight to the South you'll see an elementary school a block away and across the street from that is a church and my wife worked as a volunteer on after school tutoring program for kids at that church for 15 plus years and during the time that this whole gentrification was going on and what she saw and everybody that was there saw was that the neighborhood became much more tranchant you know there were people living there before the McDougall initiative which have lots of positive effects don't get me wrong
that couldn't live there long and there's a lot of turnover and a lot more unrest in a lot more unsettled and trouble you know
so the larger Point here is not to argue the merits of gentrification or the horrors of homelessness it's to say that any time you introduce a change to a very complex system you solve some problems and you create others and at the end of the day if you solve some problems especially if I doing so you make a lot of money I think that creates an obligation to address some of the problems that your success has caused to be fair the McDougall Corporation is a generous and tinting the people the McDougall family are fine people they've done Yeoman work for the City of Lubbock and you know it's had its had a decidedly mixed a fact but that is always always the case they should do this just imagine
you got a half hour sometime on a nice you know late fall-early winter day get a cup of Starbucks and just walk through that area and look around at the Overton Hotel and this condo building in that restaurant and imagine it just close your eyes and imagine 25 years ago looking more like say the Oak Cliff area of Dallas or something at least maybe I'll be quicker to of that I don't know
and you know what sort of absorb the good of that but then ask yourself at what cost and we know what does that leave for the rest of us while maybe another cup of coffee but think about it just play around with it
you will become an urban ecologist if you do that you will examine the relationships between people and their city as the nature of that City changes or as the nature of that city is changed
backtrack a little bit and give you a couple of examples sociology license from weird places especially is before I became a sociologist I think this is why I decided to do this at the Henry Aaron sociology lesson from my parents and their neighbor I got a really interesting sociology lesson from a guy who was the sole proprietor of a pharmacy back in 1980s almost this is almost non-existent you don't run family pharmacies anymore CVS and Walgreens and others have bought them all up anyway
he and I were just having lunch cuz he was a night in the member of my church and on the board and we were talking about the city in which I had moved fairly recently prior to that Joliet Illinois which is one of the larger sort of Southwestern suburbs of the city of Chicago and Joliet Illinois has been around quite a while and the city was built precisely because A River Runs Through It the Des Plaines River splits the city of Joliet smart idea build a city on a river you can get what you need off boats that can come from anywhere and a lot of cities fan and still there were just sort of different parts of the city that you experienced in different ways and I'll West Joliet was where the shopping mall was where most of the restaurants were I can't remember it was just
and I East Rowley at there was a City Hospital not a private hospital and the welfare office in a lot of other places and West Joliet was predominantly Anglo East Joliet was predominantly non-anglo and it had been that way pretty much forever
not know. So much Angela non-anglo although that's what it turned out to be with basically rich and poor Joliet river Des Plaines River separating
which is a reality but also a metaphor in some way my friend the pharmacist said you know and a story in the paper recently about racial tension you know the kind of stuff we are seeing all the time still cops black kid whatever it was and he said to me in Joliet Illinois for race relations Is to fill the river with cement
only got four Bridges let's build more Richards essential now it's unworkable
but it goes to the point you know what is it that separates us and how
how does that work out Lubbock Texas is a very similar kind of City without the river we have the interstate i-27 by sex Lubbock and too much the same effect you know you think about where I mean you're very long and having a PhD in sociology help when it occurred to me that I need nothing to run my life that requires me to go east of i-27 nothing on our side of the interstate
perspective summer trying to find the best barbecue joints on the east side and there are several and they're really good what about what I think is the most authentic in among the best little Mexican restaurants in town and I believe it's still there is a place on 35th and Avenue a call to Rosita's anybody know it
you should try at 35th and Avenue a you have to go very far across Interstate 27 it's still okay
brand new South Plains Food Bank building is on the east side of town that's an interesting story CEO of the food bank he's something of an acquaintance and I was at a lunch and I said and they just put up a brand new building state-of-the-art whiz-bang in this Food Bank building in the country at that point and I stayed JT and Margaret Talkington South Plains Food Bank building
philanthropists in Lubbock the Talkington family established the Talkington trust they were a couple that were married and we're in business by Margaret Talkington own a dress shop and JT I think was a farmer investor had some oil money and so on and so well the trustees of the foundation do they hired after JT and Margaret past just said you know what it is just costing us too much time and money to manage all this money in this way we're going to liquidate the trust was going to give it all away
so they went to the CEO of the food bank and said we're liquidating a lot of money what do you need he said I need a truck
you said think bigger
YouTube building how much would that cost get back to you 3 Days Later 10 million dollars really
can we put the talking to name on it
it took that long to get a 10 million dollar building from the right place serving countless
folks with food in Lubbock generosity that's my point but it's on the east side of town was invented I think by a politician named George Mahon who got Federal money in I don't know how he did this I did maybe the shortest interstate highway in the US all it does is go from Lubbock to Amarillo and that's it and there used to be a four-lane highway
basically got repaved and renamed I don't know how that happened but it has the same effect of separating
there's a library over there where I went to and I think I told you about the day President Obama was elected in an African American woman I took a picture at that Library cuz she just voted there was pretty stunning anyway Urban Ecology in a relationships between people buildings Bridges Rivers
City stuff fair enough
okay got a piece on City Life and then a piece that's not on there on small towns and it's his peace that I just like because it makes me think of people I care cared about in a particular way
and you're still going to get out early don't worry about a 10 or 15 minute lecture left to go start your time clocks
who lives whose home is a city San Antonio Houston Metroplex that kind of thing
who laughs at Lubbock inwardly but not publicly
price on a small town
who when they first landed at Lubbock in Texas Tech Heather we're scared to death
said he's kind of an interesting place and Lubbock I think it's kind of interesting in a way that I bring a perspective to this cuz I love City Life I really do live in the city of Chicago and thought for a while my life would never be full and complete until I got back there then I remembered the year that 40 in of snow hit in three days. Functional City infrastructure and bringing it to a screeching halt
the big honkin blizzard-like that'll do they were taking women in labor to hospitals on snowmobiles imagine that
anyway I mean if you imagine living in a city of some substantial size Austin or bigger within the next five years and you'll probably do that with your spanking new Texas Tech degree Macon 65000 on a sunny day probably closer to 48 V on the list
she's going and you'll wind up probably paying more rent than you are now in a place that's smaller than the one you live in maybe I don't know and to be surrounded by people and yet largely all alone because you haven't been to establish the networks in Connections in what we call Community Center maybe you know get on a bus or drive have a 40 minute commute to an office building let's say you're a professional job sure and you know you work for some cheap assistant to an assistant chief that assigns you a cubicle and change you there from 9 to 5 sounds heavenly doesn't it
that's why I'm here
now it's going to be better than that eventually but you're going to start out you know that's how a lot of people see the city you know and you're in a work your way out of that but you'll be working next to a living next to a lot of people for whom the lonely crowd is the way of life that's there that's their life and they can only make a life in a city because that's where the city has the kind of work they can do and keep the keep the job steady in the paycheck living largely you know paycheck-to-paycheck perspective in Dallas who's familiar enough with that to go like this nice couple of nice really nice restaurants yeah fairly expensive apartments in oh that's an example of an Urban Village and then that lifestyle is the lifestyle to which a lot of people Aspire you know I want to get enough education to get the chi
work that will pay me enough to live this way I want to live this way and I don't even necessarily want a car cuz it would cost me $900 a month just to park the thing I can Uber my way to work I've got enough for that cetera
some old friends were in town just last night and they live in New York City and there's a couple of my age in their two daughters were both in their early forties and both of them are Urban villagers and this one girl works for a company that kind of manages the the bookkeeping of a very large hedge fund and all she could talk about how she's been all over the country meeting clients and doing sales work and just having the time of her life and she lives in Midtown Manhattan and can afford to do that that's the Urban Village Life they were talking about and I'm going to know God love you Stephanie that's great
and I don't know what kind of like Lubbock this is a small digression I kind of like love it I like it I love the Metroplex event for 3 days I love New York for 4 days
and because I live in Lubbock I can more or less afford to go anywhere like that for a while
and I'm kind of glad to get back or you can do 90% of what you can do anywhere for about 10% of a hassle to Papa Doe's restaurant in the Metroplex
got a factor in a 40 minute commute in 30 minute wait
at least on a sunny day it's Pappadeaux's light but it's the same Corporation 90% we got a couple of other really cool places that you can go you know
one that we we had dinner last night at one of the trendiest nicest restaurants in Lubbock and it took me 12 minutes to get there
not no traffic it's on the other side of town from where I live a little love
pick your poison folks the only question you need to answer for yourself is how do you want to live how do you want to live and he has options
they never leave the lonely crowd and Ferb and villagers that becomes
what is a scarce resource in some way
and for a lot of people City Life is an arena of conflict
and by that I mean the agenda
from start to finish is to survive
by example of this is a guy that I hope is doing well because he was really doing well at what he was doing when I encountered him we did not meet particularly my wife and I went to New York and spent three nights we got a discount weekend rate to stay at a little place called the Essex House hotel which is on Central Park South it overlooks the park and the horse carriages and all that it's one of the most expensive plots of land in America Central Park in New York in the surrounding area
all right
free breakfast was not only you know the stuff you get it at the Comfort Suites you know that that has the guy who did not speak English but was a very pleasant and highly-skilled, can you just put it like this and he smiled and said something that appeared to be from a country in the neighborhood of Nigeria and here probably within the previous year to try to make his way in the world my fantasy is Italy owns his own restaurant by now cuz this was about 10 years ago I have no idea but I do know this that when he and I met my day had been fairly simple
put on my scrubs and slides and went downstairs and had an omelet that's what I did he I suspect in order to get to work at 6 woke up probably about 4:15
and stepped over probably four or five people with whom he lived in a one-bedroom or maybe even one room apartment fire distance from Midtown Manhattan got on the bus that got on a train that maybe to another bus to the back of the hotel and then made Schmucks like me killer omelettes
his day is survival mode my day is hey I'm having a good time in New York and on how did I get to do that
well I wasn't born in a developing country
and I've done a lot of people that have been born into a developing countries have risen above that and I'm making no judgment about any of that I'm just saying I've been a lucky guy
how much is one of the best universities public universities in America that had the top sociology department when I was there and still does and I had no idea
I just got planted 90 miles away I want you to watch out for people in your life and in your world
and I count myself among them on the first part of this little this little truism
get the metaphor you know you can be born halfway to First you can be born on third base almost everybody that sitting in an American University or working at 1 was born on third base while I just showed you the world wealth calculator so be wary of people that were born on third base and who think they had the triple
watch out
that's the point
I don't know why I was born here or there and you don't either and you don't have to feel guilty about that it just you know creates a sense of self understanding in your world in your community and in your population that I think is worth holding onto you know get your own dirt who's Dirt is it whose car was it just a mindset that I'm just kind of kind of winging this folks
next time you're back home in the city or the next time you're driving through one or enjoying one imagine all of the people that live where you are whose perspective is different than the one you have when you get a free omelette overlooking Central Park South Central Park North it's on small-town life who comes from one of those
you know I didn't and have learned
to love not so much how small-town people live but the
the creativity that comes from that and the ability to appreciate
what you have instead of what you think you need there's a and I don't mean to idealize that I'm not painting it well I guess I am painting a Norman Rockwell picture here
but there are elements of all life and all forms of life that are worth keeping in our heads so that we understand their value instead of judging them as inferior or Superior one way or the other in the story I'm about to tell you really does sound it feel like and I would not begin to say I want to live this way but I appreciate the people who do and what they do for each other that's the point
my first preaching job was in a town called Macomb Illinois and that's the end of the part of Illinois that they call it for geitonia as in if it's not Chicago we can forget about you in West Central Illinois it's about a hundred miles west of Peoria which is sort of in the middle of Illinois
my church was there and I left the church gig and went and got a master's degree at Western Illinois while I was doing that I got a little church gig at a town 20 miles from Macomb which I already thought was the smallest town I've ever encountered and had to live
but I got a job at the Presbyterian Church in a little town called Fountain Green Illinois population 89 I'm not making this up
the only two non residential buildings that were still being used in this town where the Presbyterian Church where I work on Sundays and to which I came to do a little calling once or twice a week and kitty corner from the Presbyterian Church in auto salvage yard
the only two non residential buildings that had electricity in the town there was a main street that had you know you know what towns of 89 is that at Main Street's what they look like
and the junkyard really was sort of the Town restaurant to cuz he had a candy machine
and it was a mr. coffee in there that he may just terrible coffee in and a wood stove sitting right in the middle of it so kind of make the rounds right on this 10 below degree January day bright Sunshine wandered into the junkyard to get a cup of coffee and Joe Spangler is there 52 lives with his mom
and we sit down and put your feet up next to the wood stove tell lies and Joe says you know you really ought to go see Mom today I go really she all right she's 90 and when somebody tells a preacher you got to go see the 90 year old lady that annoys Endwell right by score
it's good to be the preacher when you go visit Mamie who just made apple pie in West Central Illinois in the middle of forgottonia down the main road down the dirt road past where Leo Dale's Uncle used to live
if you don't know where that is we probably don't need you here
small town life am I mistaken on that how do you get from here to there you go down that road does that wrote have a number yet I don't know what it is just go where Leo Dale's Uncle used to live
okay turn on the GPS turn left at Leo Dale's uncle's old house
Park and going to use and smell the wood smoke coming out of the out of the chimney in the apple pie and I've made me and I had a wonderful time and this was just a killer apple pie and I will tell you that I'm at 10 below de the warmest spot in Hancock County Illinois was it made me Spanglish kitchen Norman Rockwell painting
until I also tell you I swear to God the coldest place in that whole County was the upstairs bedroom in the same house
the wood stove
just a I made my admirer the Grid in the creativity of people that I've learned to care about over the years and I count all of us among those you know we all bring different points of view and perspective to wherever we are but we buy n large need the same thing we want to get up in the morning and lift through the day
and that's pretty easy for most of us when I get up in the morning and maybe reflect and wax philosophical
that's great when I get paid to do it and can make you sit here
etc etc get the idea none of this is to make you feel guilty to hopefully generating you a sense of well-being no matter what your circumstances at least a little bit into maybe crank up a little generosity of the holiday season who's sitting here waiting for the route for the good stuff to Greg Abbott day
Tuesday
thanks a lot of everybody
