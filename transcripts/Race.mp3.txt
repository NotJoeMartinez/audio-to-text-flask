morning everybody
 so you know why skeletons are so easy to get along with
 skeletons easy to go on with you nothing gets under their skin
 shabby sorry
 Play the song Blackbird as sort of our only entry music today because that was written according to interviews with John Lennon and Paul McCartney it was written as an homage or out of respect to the struggle of African American women and it's a two memorable song so that's part of what we're finishing the stratification social class diversity peace
 we've had a general understanding of the distribution of wealth and power through the Eiffel Tower in the Titanic we've looked at that with regard to age and gender and sex especially with an eye toward
 harassment and violence especially toward women
 got an interesting piece on religion and diversity on Tuesday and I really appreciate your attention to my friend and your questions in your comments and if you have more of those either for me or for him I would I would welcome that and I would pass them along
 today we're taking the Eiffel Tower and examining it not so explicitly although in one place just that
 with regard to the distinction between Anglo and other and talking about stratification diversity wealth and power and its distribution by race both sort of explicitly and micro-level is Tuesday or next class. Same as always there will be a review on Monday at 4 in the same room in the media and communication building so are there any questions about the material or coming attractions
 anything at all
 I want to start this piece today by just giving you a mind picture Goodall picture in your mind can you not an 11 year old girl
 11 year old girl who lived in Topeka Kansas in 1950 and all she wanted to do was go to school she loved learning
 and the good news for her was there was a public school two blocks from her home back then everybody walk to school it would have been an easy walk even in Topeka even in the winter
 but she did not attend that school she instead walked six blocks past the school closest to her home six blocks to a bus stop where she got on a school bus and was bust another 45 minutes to the school she attended
 anybody know this little girl's last name
 got a shiny new dime I think if anybody can get it
 Uncle Frank ever give you a shiny new dime for something
 who had it
 Linda Brown she and her family with a plaintiff's in inarguably
 in arguably the most important Supreme Court decision in the twentieth century Brown versus Board of Education 1954
 which declared that separate but equal schools were by definition not equal
 and it became illegal to separate and have a black school to which black kids were busting a white school in white neighborhoods etc etc
 I guess the larger question is what was this black family doing in that white neighborhood but that you'll have to research that yourself
 which is not to say we stopped segregating schools we certainly didn't stop segregating colleges the first African American student at the University of Mississippi first African American student at the University of Alabama in schools throughout the South
 their entry into a classroom like this or a building like this was often accompanied by members of the National Guard and decry the by the governors of those States Lester Maddox and George Wallace to be specific
 Texas Tech have its first black student admitted
 67-68 something like that and they did it in the summer which was really cool cuz nobody noticed it's just like a regular admit and then when the fall came and wait a minute. We have a black student yeah but you know he's been here for a while let's move on
 not high drama that was really smart and the fact that they had to strategize that to that degree tells us a lot about how hard it may still be
 to implement Brown V Board of Education how my family and I always vacation for one week in the summer at the same place the beach in Gulf Shores Alabama where we got married and now I must be 15 plus years ago the people that were staying in the house next door to us and I the guy and I were talking about a story in the Mobile Alabama news that week that the property taxes in mobile we're going to double and of course everybody hated that idea doubling the property tax manager and he was not worried about that
 he said the property taxes Mobile on $100,000 house is 300 a year 25 a month that's next to nothing and they're doubling it to 600 maybe and people were going nuts
 thinking why would people go nuts on that and then I remembered I was a sociologist in my schools are funded primarily by property tax revenue and the percentage of property tax that's collected on the value of homes and and businesses goes to fund Public Schools if you have low property taxes
 that's a way to underfund public schools and it's a way to give wealthier people who don't pay much property tax on their wealthy homes extra money to send their kids to private schools so in fact
 we can segregate schools by manipulating the property tax laws so we're pretty creative
 when it comes to dealing with
 scary diversity and so we're going to talk about today
 we know this because we have
 rather profound and dramatic examples of prejudice and discrimination directed toward minority groups so need to find those terms and have a fairly extended PSN discount on prejudice and discrimination
 minority group is a the textbook definition is a category of people category of people who are distinct in some way
 will you can tell apart from other people who are distinct in some way usually this involves most prominently skin color
 country of origin
 hello my friend Tom would say that he is distinct in some way and that becomes known he whines up a part of the minority group
 Calgary people distinct in some way and this important part of the definition and subject to social disadvantage you can tell them apart
 and they live in a world that treats them unfairly their subject to social disadvantage because of being a member of minority group
 and the key feature of this is that it is not necessarily a numerical minority it's not just we have more than you
 the most dramatic I think historic example of this is the country of South Africa until the late 20th century that was ruled by a small number of Dutch Colonials
 and essentially created a not quite genocide all environment called apartheid against the far more numerous black African and as they were called in that era and in that place coloreds those of mixed race the apartheid
 government policy is an example of an extreme
 level of cultural prejudice and discrimination directed at category of people that were by far more numerous than the ones in power
 I'll ask about I shouldn't say less dramatic because it is pretty dramatic but the ratio is different women in the United States are a numerical majority not by much 51 to 49 and change
 but I think they are women in the US are in arguably subject to social disadvantage not just because of the obvious $0.20 on a dollar wage Gap but because of the vastly disproportionate level of
 expectations with regard to home and childcare and with regard to assumptions about how okay it is to harass them
 even in spite of fairly recent legislation to the contrary so I think women are subject to social disadvantage both in terms of cultural expectations monetary reward for their work and also assumptions about what it's okay to do to women so when I qualify the numerical minority
 we should invent a different term because all minority that's less fewer people must be that my nuts not necessarily the case
 prejudice and discrimination or parallel turns let me just to find them quickly and then go into a lengthy piece and I'll tell you what the title that is Prejudice is an unfounded attitude
 when founded meeting it there is no evidence to support it
 an unfounded attitude that
 diminishes the value of people and unfounded attitude something you believe something people come to believe
 discrimination is behavior directed toward a category of people based on those prejudices
 so Prejudice is an attitude
 discrimination is a behavior
 finally are you doing
 I can read Greek you connected to the Greek system in a frat guys
 is this is painful isn't it are you in the same group and you just not wearing the colors today or a different one
 I could eat depends on what you're going to say next I can spot frat guys a mile away going to smell very good for one thing
 here you go and you know what you call a frat guy with a c average gifted
 I crack myself up that's terrible
 you getting the irony on this and I'm not I'm yanking I'm yanking everybody's emotions because they have heard these statements directed not a frat guys but
 take the people you think are bad
 thank you for that I really appreciate it
 discrimination will happen when you two guys earn a c and I give you an F
 just cuz imma give you a d want to know why I do that I can
 actually I can't
 but you know there are
 power Brokers in our culture
 that do something
 is absurdly similar
 because they can
 we'll talk more about that
 now there's a level of discrimination
 that rises to the macro now I was just talking about I'm sort of in the room personal level of discrimination by just screwing around with grades because of whatever
 but there's a phrase called institutional discrimination
 on a macro level which refers to outcomes that are different for in this case anglos and others
 and the peace that I'll get you the illustrates institutional discrimination comes a little bit later in this lecture when I talk about the wealth difference between anglos and others it's built into it seems our culture when the average net worth of anglo-americans is so different than all other minority groups has become institutionalized as it work so there are two levels of discrimination
 personal an individual out of micro level in a room
 it also institutionalized through things that we can measure where it becomes clear that one group is disadvantaged in some way but by some process and I'll illustrate that later but I want to do it fairly extended piece on personal prejudice and discrimination and the title of the pieces this is my wire this is my wire
 I think I know I have and I'll tell you about it in a second everything that we learn
 is the result of a wire being connected in our head you know if we memorize a script for a play or if we learn that there are three perspectives perspective symbolic interaction interaction is macro functionalist conflict stability inequality
 the oxidation reduction equation I don't know if anybody gets that wire connected let me know I'd like to I'd like to learn it so that's why I stopped being chemistry major
 I think we all have also a wire that gets connected in our heads
 that through which flow assumptions about people different than us and it doesn't matter who you are or what category you're in
 I think everybody is taught something
 some assumptions some expectations maybe some prejudices about people different than you and this typically happens when we're children and we don't question much the things that we learn when we're 6
 but it's also true from a psychological point of view that anything you learned can be unlearned you can unhook wires
 I want to talk to you about
 my wire on Prejudice and the extent to which it sorted legitimated a sense of entitlement and even to to permit discrimination permit doing things differently to people different from meet legitimated that I have two stories with this I'm going to tell you the moment I remember it vividly
 and I remember it may be even more vividly the moment it was disconnected and we're talkin about my entire Public School Educational life I learned at 6 something about black
 and I unlearned it when I was a senior in high school
 at 6 I'm a baseball fan go to watch the World Series in St Louis on television
 anyway I had tickets to the game
 Big baseball fan since I'm a child my grandmother
 introduce me to baseball and I'm sitting on the floor of my parents and our home the the home that they had just purchased and had a mortgage on about a year earlier than when the story occurs
 baseball cards big Milwaukee Braves fan 20 miles from Milwaukee and I've got my baseball cards cards were in their positions that they play Teddy Matthews at third base Del Crandall catching Warren Spahn pitching Joe Adcock at 1st and in right field number 44 who's that
 anybody know
 is the non steroid enhanced home run King and Karen
 is the only card that I have of a guy that is not a white guy at that point and as I'm messing with my cards I hear my parents talking to the couple that are among their closest friends Hulu free homes down and whose son is also a friend of mine he doesn't have to be over that day but these for adults all of them are very important in my life my own parents and the parents of my closest friend are having a discussion and I'm planning my baseball cards for sale sign went up for sale and I don't know which adult set it
 but one of them said I sure hope a black family to move in across the street
 at Fort. Myers
 baseball cards black family
 first sociology lesson I believe I ever heard of this is entirely and completely accurate as I recall it I picked up my Henry Aaron card and I said what can be great
 stop my parents cuz they're Braves fans too and I believe it was my mother that said well
 that wouldn't be horrible but I don't think we've won his friends around anyway
 and my parents my mother especially our operating cuz she's my mother had never grown up in a home that has a mortgage or that they owned is at 4 and another at my dad's house our first home the fear the fear which is what Prejudice is at its root is fear the fear is that if a African-American family moved in and that became widely known when other houses went up for sale they would the value of that sale would go down in a mixed-race neighborhood
 that became a self-fulfilling prophecy and I'll tell you why in a minute a few minutes actually we wouldn't want for reasons that I could only imagine is a six-year-old
 but I learned at that moment that Hank Aaron was categorically different than the members of his team he already knew that cuz he couldn't stay in the same hotels that credit 1955-56 760 and so on
 anyway that assumption carries on I just live with that wire in my head and I have no memories in my mind thinking to myself oh I never met a black kid in my school I have a new black kid in my school in second grade I wonder if I should be friends with him
 cuz I've learned that this would be may be treacherous I don't know
 fast forward I want to belabor the point
 and maybe one of the few people that explicitly remembers the moment that wire got on hooked I'm a senior in high school have a job and I'm a lifeguard at a pool indoor YMCA pool and I had extensive training in water safety and first aid and so on so I'm qualified for the job and I've learned a lot of good things and I'm working with another guard on a Saturday afternoon for the to open kids swim and I must have been 70 kids in the pool and it was crowded and noisy and your two of us working and we're watching the kids and the pool is one of those old sow things where it started at 3 ft and gradually went down to about 4 and then suddenly from five feet down to nine feet fairly quickly and then the nine feet are there was a diving board and sewing and packing those days for some dumb reason we didn't have a boy line between the shoot challenge the deep end
 watching like you do and I noticed in this all the splashing and noise and so on right at that point where the pool goes from 5:50 to 9 feet is something that looks out of place on the bottom of pool can't really tell what it is cuz there's too many people in too much noise in too much splashing but it's different caught my eye training is go for a closer look start counting cuz kids play games like let's see if we can fool the Lifeguard in thinking we're drowning Etc right I get you about 10 and decide this investigation so I say go to the other guy I'm going in on the bottom to my horror the body of a nine-year-old kid and I bring him up on the side of the pool and the other guard hits the button and clears the pool and calls EMS
 he has a pulse. A strong wind is hard speeding that's good news bad news is he's not breathing so training kicks in this is not a heroic story anybody that's learn how to do this can do this it's not technically difficult to do artificial respiration so after about 5 rescue breaths the kid coughs chokes and throws up boy that was good news awesome oems comes and they take him to the hospital and checked on I'm on my way home cuz I was right there the pediatrician kind of goes well done that was great got a nice letter from the executive director of the Y and I got a little piece in the paper about this big my name things kids name and sewing
 so about this was on a Saturday the following Tuesday my best friend and I come home from school and we did what we always do we come in the house get a snack go downstairs listen to music Etc well we get in and that doesn't require any interaction with anybody in the household typically back door snack basement done his mother calls me into the living room watching TV like she always does just come right out of Mad Men or what
 she calls me into the room and she said pretty proud of yourself
 not especially for what that thing on Saturday
 quote
 I hope you don't expect any extra credit for saving the life of a little n-word kid
 and I was dumbfounded you know how she knew her in the eye and said no I don't I was just doing my job just the truth but I don't expect criticism
 that's when the wire. Cut and I'll never forget it and I left it took a while for us to be civil
 but I never got over that and I'm lucky I'm lucky that somehow and I can't tell you that it's true that you know Oddball thoughts through my head but they don't connect in The Wire the same way they used to and I'm very lucky about that so I have some sort where we learned from people we trust and love something that we have at least perhaps called into question or maybe and my wife is one of the luckiest people on Earth she was taught just the opposite and learned that an empty and she is in fact the least prejudiced person I have ever met and she's very lucky cuz she grew up in the same context but her parents taught her something different medicine discrimination
 this is my wire I guess that's the that's a piece here and then de facto segregation as well did I say that
 did I talk about talk about public school funding
 I did that's called de facto segregation I'll mention it again in a minute
 now we have to regroup a little bit after that piece hold on
 let me talk about now and I'll get to what I just thought I had put in the wrong place in a second
 culturally what are
 what are the strategies for dealing with diversity we have four of them genocide segregation assimilation and pluralism these are strategies for addressing or confronting or in some way
 imagining diversity and new ways we'll see
 the most effective way of dealing with diversity at least in terms of it no longer exist is to destroy genocide is the destruction of diversity the destruction of diversity
 I know there are examples of the Holocaust being the most obvious
 the situation in Southeast Asia or the end of the Vietnam War in Cambodia
 with the genocide of countless hundreds of thousands of cambodians by the Pol Pot regime
 some would say they
 reduction of the Native American population of the u.s. by 90 + percent from the time of Columbus to the 1900s is genocide allynne could largely has to do with native population being unable to resist the Infectious germs that are brought in from from people from other countries the inability to resist disease Warfare was the other reason and then thirdly being removed and move to a non-spillable parts of the country pick that up later in the lecture two examples of the destruction of diversity that genocide is a it's actually a strategy in the news literally yesterday ethnic cleansing up going to watch the same ethnic cleansing
 Warfare to eliminate a category of people
 Plan B is to separate separate the the category separate the races segregation is the separation of diversity there is by law the law that was overturned by the Supreme Court Brown vs. Board of Education
 and then there's segregation in fact we talk about de facto segregation d e space f a c t o segregation it's just Latin for meeting in reality
 have you say de facto it makes you sound college-educated that's all
 de facto segregation means it's not
 lawful but we can do it anyway and the example I have of this is my family and I always vacation in Gulf Shores Alabama
 did I do the segment
 yeah I did that I did the piece on Gulf Shores in the schools okay
 that's called de facto segregation
 now I got to decide if I want to put this the tape of this on the internet
 do I have to tell you I mean that the the whole the whole wire piece is hard to tell and I and I just lost track of where I have been in what happened the Alabama de facto segregation property tax manipulation goes in the segregation part of the lecture and in the first-class eye on the Fly stuck it in the intro
 so then I couldn't remember where I put it in this class so it's all my fault but I've already told you about manipulating property taxes to keep the school segregated right okay that is none of you will miss the de facto segregation question on the test
 what
 I want to show you
 what I think is a pretty profound example of where wires get connected in our world this is a
 a scan of a segregation law in the City of Lubbock that was enacted in 1923 read it kind of hard to read actually prescribing that portion City of Lubbock within which Negroes and persons of African descent containing as much as 1% was we will quantify it do I have an eighth I don't know how do I find out in 1923 we don't have ancestry.com
 as it turns out a lot of white folks in 1923 would have been stunned to learn that by this definition they were black
 no one in that category except Bonafide servants I guess slavery wasn't completely eradicated in Lubbock
 forbidding person sell property etcetera etcetera we've we've got it that part Line south of 16th Street and East Avenue C that's that's where that's where those people can live
 unless they're living on the property basically in the apartment above the garage where they clean the house isn't in The Yards basically that was
 that was in place and not finally repealed until 1977
 I know a lot of your parents and grandparents that were doing real well in 1977 that's not that long ago
 I'm starting Seminary
 and I'll always on the books
 even taking it off the books didn't stop Banks from placing both overt and tacit restrictions on where they would write loans and approve mortgages for non-whites in the traditional white area of the City of Lubbock in that traditional white area was defined by this segregation law
 it takes a long time for that to stop
 it didn't take me long to figure out
 that there was almost nothing I needed in this town that was east of i-27
 turns out Mackenzie Park where I play softball is like a hundred yards east of i-27 so that sort of qualifies now but the shopping at the mall isn't over there there isn't a mall over there most of the restaurants are not on the east side of town the interstate 27 functions almost as a wall between East and West Lubbock and West Lubbock is by far more predominantly white in East Lubbock is by far more predominately ethnic place where I did my internship training out of church to where I learned pastoring in Joliet Illinois that town is bisected by the display I got a pharmacist tell me you get sociology lessons from anybody really I had a pharmacist tell me the best thing we could do for race relations in Joliet fill the river with cement
 East Joliet West Joliet Public Hospital in the east side
 Private Hospital private Catholic Hospital on West Side so we can
 we can figure out how to separate people and we can circumvent the law if enough people think that's a good idea as it were
 glass piece on this
 is a learned something very profound in the first Tuesday of November in 2008 and the reason I know that was the days cuz it was election day it was the day that Barack Obama was elected president and a new Jack Reacher book out and the library had it and I wanted to go get it and the only library that had it however was the Patterson Library which is on the east side of town so I thought okay I can I can Voyage over there I'll lock the doors you know whatever
 I was facetious and I hope you know that
 so I got to pull up Patterson Library lot and it's packed and then the library and polling place I get it so people are voting on one side of going to get my book and I come out and right by the sign that says both here there was a woman who looked to be in her late thirties early forties and she was with the person who is obviously her grandmother
 and they're standing by the signs of a grandmother is in younger woman is taking her picture so I did what I often do when I'm on vacation and I sort of know what's going on and I hear the grandmother say I wanted that picture
 she was 80 years old so this is 2008 she's 80 years old that means you would have been born in what 1922 that about right
 in 1922 which means she was alive under this law
 she said I never thought first of all I learned it would be hard for me to vote but I never thought I would ever vote for an African-American and then she started to cry
 and I thought this is this this needs to be preserved African-American grandmother doing anything anybody needs to feel about the Obama Administration that isn't that's a moment that's one of those pivot Points in in This Woman's life and it was caught on film so I'm glad that happened but that's the effect
 a growing up in a place and at a time that's different and I we we got real good at segregating drinking fountains restaurants schools bathrooms you know I remember as a child be taking a trip through the South and seeing a sign on a bathroom colored if my 11 year old granddaughter in Austin saw a sign on a bathroom that said color or drinking fountain maybe more accurately that said color she would wonder if the water was green and she would love that her favorite color and yet you know the crow South
 even if you grew up in the midwest with parents who had property value concerns was still a different world in this woman who voted for Barack Obama on that day was something that she was grateful she live long enough to see enough said
 assimilation is The Melting Pot Theory go-along-to-get-along it's becoming its members of the minority taking on the attributes and ideas and behaviors of the majority
 it's uncharitably called the Oreo effect by African-Americans who see other ethnic folk as acting too white black on the outside white on the inside that's what it's in relation is red on the outside white on the inside for Native populations it's seen as a negative because it is the dilution of diversity assimilation is the dilution of diversity genocide is the destruction segregation is the separation assimilation is the dilution of diversity
 character in the movie Warren Beatty play the guy named bulworth a nasty Senate candidate who drank a lot I was giving a speech while drunk and asked about issues of race relations the movie came out in 1919 90s you said the best thing we can do for race relations in America is keep screw until we're all the same color
 that's assimilation and actually technically that would work
 but do we want to live in that world
 is an interesting question I mean it's both a technical biological reality it's also a metaphor until we're all the same and icing the 70th percentile
 the delusion of diversity and it plays out an interesting ways English as the official language of the State of Florida at one point made bilingual education impossible what's that it means we'll teach kids who are native Spanish speakers because their parents came here and their first generation
 will teach him initially in Spanish so that they can learn you know and come to it to terms with this new language English as the official language prevents that tries to enforcing some way assimilation I ask myself what would it hurt 5 year olds who don't speak English or don't speak it very well to both have what they need to learn in a language they do understand but spend time with other kids who could teach them and I'll buy the way maybe the other kids will learn a little Spanish how would that hurt I learned in school which is of no help whatsoever in my life right now so when one year my wife and I just decided this will be the year for one little measure self-improvement we took some Spanish lessons that was really fun I can speak a little Spanish
 como esta pico de gallo
 I don't have to learn Spanish to get along like my friend Tom said you know we have to own the fact that not very often do you have to defend
 where you are and where you are unless you wander on the wrong side of town but why would I want to do that there's nothing for me over there other people get the idea
 this notion of assimilation dilution gives rise to a discussion called pluralism
 the textbook definition of pluralism is a condition where all groups are distinct
 but of equal value
 we can tell people apart but we don't create hierarchies and otherwise these are distinctions without differences
 not too easy to find pockets of pluralism you know I think Tom mentioned in one of the classes maybe it was this one that is he looked out on this class there was an obvious level of diversity and celebratory even his point of view much different than when he was a student in the 70s at UCLA I would say that to be true even in Wisconsin and in my time to I met my first African American fellow student as a second grader and I wasn't sure what to do about that you know
 cuz I don't have the wire
 interesting Lee religion place where Jesus loves the little children all the little children of the world you know that song rooted in good New Testament theology that's kind of where Jesus was and yet religion is the place where the races tend to be the most separate soap
 and there are forces of resistance at work in most cultures and
 2 some degrees more prominently so than others at certain points in their history I would say the resistance to pluralism has increased in the last 3 years or so
 let's get back to our program
 questions on the patterns of interaction than ways of dealing with diversity
 genocide segregation simulation fluent
 sound bites
 some lengthy some less so
 Minnesota wasp is I mean the acronym what does it mean
 anybody what's the what's the w stand for
 white
 white Anglo-Saxon Protestant Protestant essentially wasp stands for the categories of people in the first four questions of that social class and life chances questionnaire that we did on the opening day of the segment
 who are the people at the top of the Eiffel Tower they are disproportionately white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are descendants of white Anglo-Saxon people that founded our country
 these are the people as children and grandchildren have created the Mayflower Society
 we are descended from people that came here first if you are dating someone from Minnesota from Massachusetts or Rhode Island or any place in the in the Northeast and they are part of a money to Elite family and you go visit them they will want to know what your major is and the little bit about you and also probably want to know your mother's maiden name on the off-chance that your people might be are people you know
 John Kennedy was almost a wasp I guess he was a wasp white Anglo-Saxon Catholic all my gosh
 better sociology lesson I learned when I was about six the 1960 election. Kennedy against Richard Nixon and I came home and I said A week Catholic
 know why cuz we're Lutheran
 and Catholics Kennedy's a Catholic o really that must be bad I want to be Catholic because this is before Vatican 2 and all the Catholic kids in my block who went to the Catholic School two blocks away seemed like they were out playing all day long every other Friday for some obscure Saints Day they closed the school right I wanted that
 then I found out they couldn't eat meat on Fridays either I thought
 mac and cheese no school I'll take that trade no problem
 right
 but Kennedy had to defend the idea that he would not be beholden to a foreign government in the Vatican interesting huh I'm in the Vatican is a sovereign state
 and Kennedy had to pledge there would be no interference from a foreign government in his administration
 he won by a handful of votes because he carried the state of Illinois Illinois was the Florida of that election for the Michigan of the Wisconsin we want to call it the electoral votes from Illinois Carry Kennedy over the top of in the 1960 election Chicago is located early and often and may have even been funded by the mafia but there are a lot of people who tell you today the Kennedy stole that election
 and he had to pledge in part to even be legitimate that he would not accept interference reform.
 In any case wasps are the group the category from home power has had to be taken
 the founders who were buying large and the power Brokers and businessman who were buying large of this racial and ethnic makeup and religious makeup
 had most of the power for most of our country's history and it is changing some and it's scaring wasps
 and there's been some backlash to that
 one piece of so I guess the sound bite here is wasps is the Kennedy Factor get that and you sort of get the idea mericans have faced a legacy of institutionalized discrimination or give you in Fairly graphic detail of what this means there's a link here on this in the segment and you may have looked at it called racing well and I want to expand this a little bit
 worsening wealth inequality by race I made the point in the Eiffel Tower like sure that well net worth is the most robust indicator of social class in life and these are just the average numbers that go with white Asian Hispanic and black net worth a hundred and ten almost under 11,000 for why it's not quite 70,000 Asian 7500 or so Hispanic 5000 black there's a 22 full difference in net worth between Anglo and African-Americans what is this about
 research says the most robust reason for that 20 to fold disparity is inheritance explain this this is 2000 and let's go a 2020 because the arithmetic is easier so we had 20 years in the 21st century a hundred years in the 20th century that's a hundred and twenty years and from 1865 to 1900 was 35 years so 35 + 20 is 5555 years today from the Emancipation Proclamation a hundred and fifty-five years is all it is to sequential lifetimes someone who is 80 years old today
 on the year they were born would have been alive along with an 80 year old
 who lived prior to the Emancipation Proclamation so that's like two lifetimes from
 The Inheritance matter now the Mayflower Society people I've been heralded land and money from generation to generation to generation if you were an African-American slave
 two people's lifetimes ago that's not very long
 you did not own or could inherit property you in fact were the property other people inherited you can read Wills that were written in the 1850s that will be squeezed acres of land bushels of corn values of homes and ranches oh it also each of my kids get a third of my slaves
 interesting huh
 inherited wealth means you have become the benefactor of generations of wealth
 and money
 it takes longer than two lifetimes to go from being property to having property get the idea it's really not more complicated than that
 and most of this well is inherited wealth or well that was inherited and wisely invested and then you get more wealth that way
 so that's the big difference of the issue I think here under this segment is the wealth disparity generated by inheritance tied to the relatively recent proximity of slavery get the idea
 back to our program
 I've to sound bites on Latino Latina Hispanic culture in the US

 concerns agribusiness this meeting I'm going to this conference I'm attending in St Louis next week is the society for the scientific study of Religion. That's the one meeting I go to every year sometimes it goes the other ones but I always go to this one and there was a presentation at the society quit on an interesting case study of a Catholic Church in Marshalltown Iowa Marshalltown Iowa little town smack in the center of Iowa it's one of the whitest towns in one of the whitest states in the United States and the case study on the one and only Catholic Church in town had to do with the way they adjusted and coped with in some ways a very sudden influx of several families of immigrants from Mexico
 imagine making your way from Mexico as an immigrant legal or illegally and deciding you want to go to Marshalltown Iowa. It never snows people talk like me I like the food Etc Marshalltown Iowa
 vast numbers such a completely change the, the demographics of the one and only Catholic Church obviously
 when you were young did you learn the phrase this little piggy went to Market This Little Piggy stayed home this little did set regular know this little piggy went to Market not to shop why do Piggy's go-to-market I live under the illusion that baby back ribs and bacon grow in packages no they don't they're herded into slaughterhouses and somebody cuts them into pieces for my benefit who does that
 the Meatpacking poultry
 business is the base labor is driven by immigrants these are terribly difficult extraordinaire Elite dangerous really unpleasant jobs
 cutting up creatures and turning them into food
 and suddenly I'm meat packing plant open in Marshalltown Iowa and then we're job opportunities
 so that's the first piece Pig killing in Iowa the second piece will come back to that same place I call it the salad bar restaurants that have salad bars I can't like those or maybe even the buffet line is not just a salad bar it's fried chicken and roast beef and all that other good stuff they package or they presented the salad bar in explicit and in particular way it's usually the first thing you see is a big bowl of lettuce right that's the cheapest stuff in the salad bar and they want you to load up your plate on that and then you go on down a little bit more vegetables cheese eggs potato salad slowly working your way up to the really good stuff hunks of ham in the fried chicken right
 what's imagine the life cycle of the stuff on the salad bar let's just start with the lettuce for a minute got a big silver bowl of lettuce that's been pulled into pieces right somebody took a head of lettuce or a bunch of lettuce depending on the kind and in a room in that restaurant pulled it apart and shoved it in the bowl and then set it on the counter right somebody did that somebody else took a box of those bunches are heads of lettuce off a truck and put him in the restaurant
 somebody drove that truck full of lettuce to the restaurant
 they drove it on a road that was constructed by people
 they drove it from a warehouse there were other people work packaging lettuce heads and other things in boxes
 those lettuce heads were delivered to the warehouse on a truck on roads built by somebody from a field where they were packing they were picked in package is this getting exhaustive
 by the time you grab a tongues and put a hunk of lettuce on your plate that has been touched by dozens of people literally and figuratively the ones who picked it truck to pull it apart built the roads that the truck went on right
 are almost by Design some of those people are not just first-generation Americans immigrants in a while a meat packing plant or a poultry plant will get raided by immigration Naturalization and people will be deported but it becomes a revolving door
 everything on a salad bar has put you literally in touch with diversity in all of its forms including and maybe even most prominently quote unquote illegal immigrants mean people are not legal or illegal to behave in ways that are illegal illegal
 but took sort of the conceptualize that is legitimacy of a person is a whole other issue
 but here's the point we don't think about this very often a lot of a stone so I want to take you into the into the salad bar and at least peek into the window of the hog killing plant
 I don't want to remind you of one other thing there are three primary features that drive the Mexican economy one is tourism
 2 is illegal drugs
 3 is money that goes into the Mexican economy through the postal system from immigrant labor in the US back to Peasant Village in Mexico their family members
 immigrant labor comes to the US with tremendous pull factors for jobs even really really hard and dangerous jobs
 so that they can be they can do well for their families
 these folks are hard-working they're generally pretty quiet
 and they are feeding the Mexican economy to a greater degree than any trade agreement we have ever had or ever will have
 so here's my advice in this is the punchline to this whole segment on the salad bar and the end and pig killing
 my advice to you is to do this get on the internet and find out the name of the biggest company in Mexico that makes 15 foot ladders
 and buy stock in it
 if we build it they will come
 you're such a cool fact if we really really really wanted to stop immigrants from Mexico or anywhere else we would get into economic relationships with the economies to build that up
 no one would come here to do crappie work if they could do decent work in their own country it's that simple
 so you know take it for what it's worth but that's just my crude way of conceptualizing it is they will come
 because it's not only beneficial to the people that come here they are trying to make lives better for people they love and from whom they have left and may never see again that's what's going on
 quick song by than Asian and Native Americans of all non-anglo immigrant groups Asians from China Japan the Pacific Rim southeast Asia in India
 in that area they tend to do better we looked if you flip back to that well thing Asian at net worth is almost 70,000 so it's 70% of Angela net worth 65% or so there lots of reasons for the commonly the commonly cited reason is why they're willing to work hard and assimilate and they are Asian immigrants will work they come here with a strong work ethic tied to strong family ties and they are more willing than most other groups to assimilate to become more like the dominant culture in those are all factors but the most important factor
 NY Asian immigrants do better is they come here with more
 they come here with more money and more education
 then the pain killers and lettuce Pickers they come here with more and God love them all I'm not making that distinction in any other way than to Simply make a comparison
 Native Americans that's wait a minute. That's not an immigrant group is it hold on a second
 I don't think Columbus Day gets widely celebrated on the reservation
 Columbus discovered America I was taught as a child
 and then I couldn't figure out how is he discovered it there were people already here didn't they discover it did they look down and go America
 anyway and I mentioned earlier in the lecture on the genocide that the native population was reduced by 90% or better because of inability to resist infection and warfare and relocation
 that's sort of what
 reparations are you know you may know of people you may have come from a family of people that grew up in a reservation and we're given government checks
 all that does is make you dependent it doesn't make you an entrepreneur it doesn't make you empowered in any way which is why I thought it was so interesting when growing up in Wisconsin. I was in high school when this happened my time was 20 miles or so north of the Illinois border which meant that there were things in Illinois that you could get that you couldn't get in Wisconsin and so we went and got them and vice-versa what are things you can get in Illinois that you can get in Wisconsin with lottery tickets and there were Factory groups that would send in a rotating people every week down to Illinois to get a hundred lottery tickets and then bring them up to the factory since and then the legislators got together as a tall whole for cry-eye that's money going into Illinois we could have a lottery to and we could keep the money all the great idea so they sign the lottery Bill and 9 seconds later the Potawatomi tribe open the casino because suddenly gambling was legal in Wisconsin what was more than 9 seconds but less than you think cuz they were ready
 by treaty anything it was legal in the state with legal without restriction in the reservation and gambling said the legislators we didn't think of that. And casino bankrupt the casino that's not the casinos fault
 in any case that's the level of attention and Entrepreneurship that we see in Native culture and I've been privileged as of late to learn more about the Quanah Parker Trail and Quanah Parker's presence in this part of West Texas in the story that that involves and so you should look that up the Texas city of Quanah is named after Quanah Parker and you should just play around with that Google it
 so the sound bite is a come here with more and
 the dependency problem with reparations to Native culture
 question so we got another whole thing we're going to do and I've got another just another bit but other questions so far
 obviously it's Greg Abbott day and I suppose there were some of you that woke up and somehow feel like going to class but wait a minute we haven't had that 4. day yet it's got to be today
 take a minute take out a sheet of paper put your name in the date on it and I will explain the Greg Abbott they with One More Story
 Tumblr texting your friends get to class quick
 okay let me know if you're telling me have your undivided attention for a second we please
 I am
 I go through a lot emotionally when I do this lecture and there's a lot of Bleak imagery about who can make it better and I actually heard that in the context of the whole wall debate who can make it better baseball
 20 years ago I bought one ticket to go see the Texas Rangers who am I like because I like baseball but I'm not especially a fan
 but they were playing the Seattle Mariners and 20 years ago I wanted to see the Seattle Mariners play because I really wanted to see before he retired I wanted to see the center fielder for the Mariners play in person and that person was Ken Griffey jr. maybe you know who that was a Hall of Famer sweetest left-handed swing just an unbelievable Talent
 and Derek Jeter probably though so the star players of their generation and home plate is over there which means the on-deck circle is right here in about the sixth inning Griffey is in the on-deck circle waiting to hit and the batter file tips of 4 years after baseball players went on strike and started estimated interest in Major League Baseball so the players have been school now to be like this cuz I'm a memorabilia collector and I would love a game-used baseball Touch by Ken Griffey jr. Doll lame that is right so I'm over there doing my ass looks past me a point to who he's going to give the ball
 they walked over and in the front row is a guy's is a kid of a blue-eyed blond hair curly haired boy in the arms of his father who's also blond and blue-eyed and Griffey reaches out his big African-American hand around a white baseball and then the image I have in my mind is this big black hand and white baseball
 gifting a tiny little white kids hand you know and it's almost like a wire is connected right and maybe that kid grows up with a different set of assumptions in what I learned about my Hank Aaron baseball card and what this means for you the title to as two or three sentence essay is this is my wire not mine this is for better or worse that you have either tried to unlearn or struggled to keep in place this is my wire and idea to an ethic and a little kid
 with a baseball just might make it better thank you
