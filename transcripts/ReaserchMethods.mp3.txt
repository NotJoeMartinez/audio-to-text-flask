morning everybody
 well it's Dad joke time
 what did the traffic light say to the car
 the traffic light say to the car don't look I'm changing
 bad huh
 okay we are moving toward exam one which is a week from today it will be in this classroom at this hour give you a little heads-up you going to eat an orange Scantron the one with five answer choices I'll send you an email to this effect later in the week will be a review session for the test that will be on Monday it'll be in the mask on building a room 281 that's the big lecture hall right in the middle of that building Haley will conduct that and she will answer your question she won't tell you what's going to be on the test I already told you it's going to be a prospective questions true-false questions and vocabulary questions
 who hates true-false questions just hate some you really shouldn't because if all else fails there are the most Fair bet in the casino
 anyway you should ask yourself if you're in front of the true or false question you're not sure what it is ask yourself what have I learned
 you're going to be tempted to say oh my gosh what did he say about that
 you don't do that memory exercises thinking exercises what have I learned now also in this lecture today and on Thursdays lecture to be a lot of vocabulary words turns to be defined you might want to take yourself back to grammar school you know when you had flashcards and on the front it was 6 X 9 and you turned it over and it said 54 make flashcards with the term and the definition and that will help you a lot so flashcards for vocabulary what have I learned 4 true-false and also put the triangle in your head the macro-micro triangle is the essence of the class and I want to go through that I just briefly one more time
 we have three ways of looking at life we have two ways of looking at life in countries and we call that a what macro or micro perspective that's the Big Mac macro point of view looking at the world looking at life and countries we have one of those two perspectives that's concerned with stability order and consensus we call that what
 a functionalist point of view inequality
 conflict and we have one perspective one point of view that looks at life in rooms and that is talking about successful people not successful countries and what's that perspective called interaction is there are lots of test questions if you which sociological perspective you should approach that with three questions in your head don't answer the question until you answer these three one is it macro or micro is it country or room if the answer that question is micro what's the test question answer that's it if it's macro you have to ask yourself one more question is it concerned with stability
 consensus in efficiency or inequality and Haves and Have Nots and then want you to know that what's the stability perspective
 and the inequality perspective
 that's how you do it don't try to answer it before you take yourself through the thought process
 turn off
 one more time any other questions about details or Logistics are coming attractions
 the test will have 50 questions 52 questions 50 substitute questions in to grammar school questions so you could get 52 out of 50
 well we have talked about competing perspectives and competing theories
 we use research methods to test
 El examen
 and look at the strengths and weaknesses of theories we test our theories and questions by collecting data
 I'm recording measurements how do we do that how do we know what to what to study
 we thought that tattoos had an interesting public interest and actually one of our research team members has a religious tattoo on his ankle so he has both personal and public interest in our latest religious Tattoo series that we're doing as far as I know there are only three published. Viewed articles on religious tattoos that have ever been written and I wrote one of them
 there are three that have been written one is about to be published in two or under review and I had a hand in writing all three of those so it's like being the best surfer in Fargo but I'm interested in religion and I'm interested in culture and I think there's a public interest in the proliferation of tattoos and how religiousness can be expressive of that so you select a topic that you care about it if you could never write a master's thesis you better care about it otherwise you'll quit you'll give up it is so hard and so frustrating you better care about what you're doing
 but there should also be some public interest and I put up at the top a citation and I've linked that article to the readings page I want you to read Patricia Yancey Martin and Robert J Commerce article fraternities and rape on campus It Was Written 30 years ago which means a lot to happen between now and then but if you sort of get the idea
 still in play anybody in college should care about wealth with the articles about date rape
 and in the era of me too and Title 9 it's all over college campuses it is
 horrifyingly under-reported which means it's horrifyingly prevalent and it's one of those questions that at least Martin and Hummer than looking at 4:37
 so there's a public interest in that and I do not know whether either of these two authors have any special personal interest in that I know that there's a startlingly high percentage of people are on this is an issue through the college experience so it's into a research question and essentially this article asks what's the relationship between social organization on college campuses Student Life
 and cry
 and those two social Concepts
 become measurable in this way
 most research articles are most research project start with the question what's up with that whatever that is is the effect something's going on in our lives that's being caused by other things it's the effect that's called the dependent variable flash card alert
 that's the dependent variable in a research question it is the effect it's what we want to measure what's up with this what causes this to change what what makes what makes their it what makes for a lot of this what makes for a little of this
 the dependent variables the effect the independent variable is the cause the more of this you have or less the more or less of that you'll have
 and did Martin and Hummers article the intensity of Greek life which will vary in a way that I'll describe it a second
 they argue that that will cause a change in or make date rape more or less likely the incidence of Date Rape is the dependent variable here how prevalent are into and what happened
 and that's the dependent variable or variables the organization of Greek life fraternity specifically and again with 30 years of hindsight now since this article was written you should bring more questions to this article then I'm not interested in how well you understand what they did I'm interested in you bringing to Bear your own inside and experience on what they learned 30 years ago
 Greek life can be organized a number different ways are colleges universities in the US that have no fraternities and sororities at all so that's the lowest level of Greek life intensity fair enough
 others have sororities but they have no place to meet on campus or elsewhere other than in places like this that are designed for other purposes classrooms conference rooms and so and that's where the groups me so that's the next level up the next level of intensity would be what Texas Tech has that is we have Greek organizations they have buildings and they meet in buildings but they don't live there are no there no living spaces in the building and then the next level up would be aware University of Wisconsin at a cutie has Greek Light Greek houses that are not just meeting places but also people live so that's the level of intensity that goes up or down and Martin Hummer arguing that the higher that is the greater the level of intensity
 the more likely
 the incidence of Date Rape will rise that's just their Theory so here's what we do we find a topic
 and then think about it that's called developed the theory not in the Martin Hummer article they have theories related to alcohol consumption and availability they have theories related to gender role expectations and masculinity and power all of that didn't play that leaves them to hypothesize that the greater the intensity of Greek life the greater probability or incidence of date right that's just their thing okay so that's a topic of Interest Brandon research question and operationalized into two variables independent variable intensity of Greek life dependent variable incidence of Date Rape questions on that
 you should read the article and think about it like what's up with that and what's up with that now
 play try to frame the issue of research question is been independent variable in a way that's a little bit more accessible let's make it something that we can talk about and think about and theorize about in this room let's imagine for example two variables that are of interest to college students I would suspect one would be great point average who cares about that
 what makes it rise or fall or what's its effect on other things who's ever thought average would you agree that those are topics of at least interest sufficient interest in this room to go on and on about it for the next 10 minutes
 income higher low grade point average high or low in that relationship between income and grade point average somebody hypothesize or think through which of those is the dependent variable could be either it will be both
 which of those in your opinion would be the dependent variable that ship to an income and grade point average anybody go
 grade point average who said that okay let's talk through this so you said the dependent variables grade point average that will rise or fall depending on something else right so just talk through your thinking a little bit why do you think that income affects grade point average and how
 I'm going to be more worried about that unless it was to focus on work and so if they have less income than their grade point average could fall due to lack of focus in class right here that this is called the I got too much crap in my life. That's what it is little income working hard to build up enough income to pay the rent in the tuition all that so the more of that you have her you have to work for that so the higher the income the lower the grade point average because you spend too much time just keep the wheels on your life this is called the hard to keep the wheels on Theory whatever it is so there's a relationship there's an inverse relationship between income and grade point average the higher the income the lower the grade point average personal income that's okay well then roll over
 Jordan 11s grade school together exactly
 not after everything settled do you want to hide grade point average so we can get a job
 so what's the independent variable in your theory here
 so income is high or low in that will have an effect on grade point average
 also grade point average is the independent variable okay so grade point average has an effect on income spell it out just to spin your theory
 okay
 so this is the work hard get rewarded Siri basically right if I'm a hiring manager and all I know about you is your grade point average that will tell me something it will tell me that you're willing to work hard and do what you're told and if you're hiring manager that's what you want so a grade point average is a proxy for that it's a proxy for working hard and following the rules so you're arguing that the higher the grade point average the more likely you are to get a better job with a higher income so that's a direct relationship we flip the variables produces a change in income in the higher the grade point the higher the income you argued that the higher the income the lower the grade point average then they're just two different theories and we could test them both and they both hold on. They both hold out one more
 okay I'll wait
 anybody help me out here
 be brave
 I guess I'm switching around the first one
 are going to pay for college might be willing to work harder in college
 yeah this is the upward Mobility theory that low household income generates ambition right so we want to we want to be the first generation to go and finish college regardless of the resources that brought us there we're going to overcome that by hard work so this is the upward Mobility success story the lower the income the higher the grade point average
 anybody got the opposite theory of that in your head go ahead
 and what's that about
 Hep C is get degrees and Dad's always hiring right
 as I call that the privilege slacker Theory and we know if we don't people like this like all of them the whole point of this whole segment is that you can take any two variables connect them in either way and come up with several different theories and then you test those theories the punchline to a theory is call the hypothesis there's another there's another flat card alert that is a summary of the relationship between two variables it's sort of a testable assertion the higher the income the lower the grade point average the higher the level of Greek life the higher the level or incidence of Date Rape it's a testable assertion as it were it link two variables together with a summary statement that we have no idea it's a hypothetical
 we then go test a hypothesis by collecting data I'mma tell you how to do that
 been in just a second but are there any lingering questions on independent and dependent variable and hypothesis and theory
 golden elegant job of theorizing about the relationship between two social variables and that's all we do in our work
 okay let's talk about the ways we collect data and then at least the social sciences anyway in a couple of days work in other disciplines as well
 the most common form of data collection in sociology is the collection of survey data the conducting of a survey I'll probably all of you have been asked to serve as a lab rat in one form or another if you answer these 50 questions you get up 4% chance of a $20 Amazon card or something
 where we conduct surveys into ways we conduct surveys by Distributing and collecting questionnaires that have closed fixed answers to closed-ended questions
 we also conduct interviews which have lengths the answers to open-ended questions
 and each of these types of data collection survey data collection have a strength and a limit on what those strengths and limits are
 every research project has to pass muster on these two things reliability and validity
 reliability
 means the process is easily repeated somebody else could do exactly this and get generally the same results
 validity means we get an answer to the question we ask we actually get the information that answers the research question that's a measure of the validity now
 what's imagine that I distribute a questionnaire to everybody on this half of the room and I one of the questions is to what extent would you say you are how religious are you
 not at all
 week
 moderate strong not hard to answer that question right
 do you think that that question if there were a hundred like it would be high and reliability could be usually repeated or high and validity that means I get an answer to the question I asked
 very reliable let me just asked by a show of hands
 how strong is your religious Faith who would I just sent this half of the room.
 who would say week
 who would say moderate who would say strong okay so we have slightly tilted towards strong ish just religious faith on this half of the room that would be easily repeat it so it's a very reliable measure but I want to know more so I might overhear have a conversation with you and say that first you know how strong is your religious faith and give me an answer but then we would talk about that you know where did that come from where did you learn to be religious or where did you reject it or whatever you know you this whole long story and you would do most of the talking I'm going to get an answer to the question I asked right
 is that going to be easily repeatable over there I'm going to get the same stuff probably not but I'm going to get a valid answer the question I asked by conducting an interview
 I'm going to get a highly reliable set of answers
 by Distributing a questionnaire now there are ways to cover the validity issue and I'll cover that when I talk about secondary data but that's just the distinction I want to make a point this out
 when you take a standardized test the SAT test or the act or if you ever take the graduate record exam of the MCAT filling out a questionnaire
 you're answering questions about what you know about the questions they put math reading whatever it is it's essentially a questionnaire it's an extraordinary all of them are extraordinary really reliable they we've been able to interpret the meaning of the SAT test for decades very reliable
 SAT test is supposed to measure the probability of success in college and the question is is that what it measures is it a valid measure of what it intends
 there's a whole lot of other research out there that suggest that maybe not what we know it measures for sure is social class and Conformity now whether or not go as planned to success is an open question but the measure designed to predict success in college is confounded by the other things that measures even better than that which is a reflection of social class and conformity
 So It suffers from validity so much so that the people who invented and distribute and make available The Graduate record exam exam that you would take perhaps some day for admission to graduate school they came out about 10 years ago and said we only will stand by the validity of the GRE that is its ability to predict success in college we will only call that valid for the first semester of graduate work
 and at that point Texas Tech University's graduate school. Requiring it they decided we can get a better measure of Student Success probability then The Graduate record exam so that's it that's what's at stake in these kinds of questions so survey data collected through a questionnaire is highly reliable
 and you have to answer the questions going to defend your work survey data collected through the conducting of an interview with highly valid
 but questionably reliable and then there are ways of fixing that
 so that's the that's at stake here
 so one more time reliability
 defined as the ability to repeat or replicate a study note they are words their reliability repeatability replication validity
 getting a measure of what you really want to know as opposed to something else
 like in the case of the SAT social class or conformity
 and Survey data conducted through the distribution collection of questionnaires is highly reliable
 but a questionable validity survey data gathered through the conducting of interviews is highly valid but struggles with reliability got it
 sure reliability is the is the the measure of repeatability or replication can I repeat or replicate the studying at the same result
 validity is does it answer the question that's asked
 do I get the information I seek where do I get other information in a different confounding way
 Mitch's ass over here let's see if I can repeat that how many of you would say your religious faith is non-existent
 week
 moderate
 strong exactly the same tilted towards strong but just just to the to the to the strong side of moderate fight take your story of religion and try to find another one it may not be repeated in the same way
 okay so that survey data we can conduct experiments now the bumper sticker experiment that I talked about on Tuesdays in play hear you conduct an experiment by taking a similar group of people and dividing them in half and doing unto half of them drug companies do this testing pharmaceutical products all the time they give you know 15 divided in half and then one of them gets a cold remedy and one of them gets a sugar pill and then we take a look at who gets called and who doesn't let me just gave half of her grad students the Black Panther bumper sticker and the other none but in a very specific moment in time right following the death horribly to Oakland Police let me talk about a different kind of experiment that's a little more generally applicable
 is do some sort of assessment of the probability of you getting into a road rage accident on the way home from school today and your rage is causing it all right you're being Road ranges in NM get rekt I can conduct an experiment to that effect the I've got hundreds of aggression measurements the questionnaires show me giving everybody in the room a 10-question measure of aggression things like when you're driving and someone cut you off to you a safely slow your vehicle do you be beep the horn do you see
 ask them in and Ganda and flip them off or do you see running into the wall
 and all those kinds of things opening score on that and play you Chopin piano music for an hour and the other half I show you a splatter film a horror movie and I hate myself for this every time I do this lecture I say myself go get the name of the film you're going to talk about what's the name of the what film has a five or six high school kids that tell their parents are going to go to the library or someplace safe and they sneak off into the woods drink get drunk and have sex and get killed one by one
 what that's what all of them that's the single plot of all horror movies
 morality play one of those right group and the splatter film group we bring you back if we give you a post test on aggression another one of those theoretically what do you think
 what does who's got the higher aggression score on the post test does splatter film sure
 not cuz once you leave the box once you leave the lab once you go out in the real world there's a million other variables now the bumper sticker experiment was elegant in that it picked a moment and a place where the defining characteristic of the culture could be encapsulated by Black Panther Party at that time and it would dissipate after a while so you can do experiments with a really hard and they suffer from what validity or reliability
 I usually replicate and I could do that a hundred times and get the same results yeah there's an I can't say a thing about road rage by conducting an experiment on aggression in movies right now
 participant observation research is
 a really refined way of essentially conducting interviews over a long. Of time sometimes are called if you are doing this kind of work you decide you want to study reindeer herders in Lapland
 how you think why that's a weird thing I had a professor in graduate school it's been 5 years living the reindeer herders in Lapland and you should look up where that is and wrote a book about it really hard to do got to get a grant to live apart from your job and then come back to your job in 5 years is at work but you get extraordinary really detailed information about a group you want to study Scott, and the gay Evangelical article in a little bit of participant observation research he joined up with the group and kind of got a sense of what they're about so very reliable or highly valid
 I need a really valid I'm going to get a story here that's compelling the piece that I'm going to talk about at the end of this lecture on Research ethics lot Humphreys book called Tearoom trade is an example of participant observation work and It suffers not only from reliability but it has some massive ethical problems and we'll talk about that at the end of the presentation today it's an elongated very complex way of interviewing people by living with them essentially and some of these some of these ethnographies are compelling book
 I've asked you if you have ever made available to you another elegant participant observation study here this is an optional book on participant observation research is called Gang leader for a day and I've given you the three PDF file the book and made it available and this is a story about a guy doing doctoral dissertation work University of Chicago in the late 80s and he becomes gang leader for a day he goes native and becomes a part of and put participant observer in a crack cocaine is compelling work
 okay
 surveys questionnaires and interviews experiments suffer from validity participant observation is strong and validity
 nobody called unobtrusive measures of existing data that is we take data that are already there and either study it or make something out of make data out of something that's already there we talk first about content analysis going to analyze the content of something that's out there we could contest analyze what people do in their spare time in Lubbock by looking at the per capita sales of Symphony tickets versus Athletic tickets versus movie tickets Etc we could do content analysis of the profitability of different forms of restaurants you know American fast-food Cajun Asian Tex-Mex that kind of stuff and get some information about the kinds of things that play well in a particular place
 somebody should really do this this is been my example of content analysis my entire career cuz I think you really could you could just turn the key on this and have a master's thesis ever been in scouting Boy Scouts Girl Scouts
 and you get well and books in the handbook there are criteria for merit badges is that right
 I want you to Imagine The Boy and Girl Scout Handbook Boy Scout Handbook Girl Scout Handbook published in 1950
 and then those same two books 1975 same two books 2000
 and the current version and imagine what boys and girls in those. Those time slots
 would be asked to do to show Maron
 would they be the same as each other would they vary over time could we do a study that way examining gender roles and masculinity and femininity I expect hypothetically that the Boy Scout Handbook in 1950 would have a Chemistry merit badge and the Girl Scout Handbook would have a cooking merit badge which is essentially the same skillset mixed up together get something in return make something together get a cake mix something together get gunpowder
 and if your cake blows up it's the same thing
 I'm guessing as we move along
 we get fewer drastic differences like that and by the time we're done here we might have
 a chef's merit badge which should be the same thing as it work and making something of it would a little quick analysis have a child's toy the box of crayons right I know without looking and there's no date on the box but this box of crayons was manufactured before 1962 before 1962 how do I know that because I took out of that box of crayons this particular cramp now all crayons haven't you can see what color it is and then the grand company will tell you the name of that color right
 Jamaican idea what this color look like
 what is the what is the title of this color cran what does a crane company say this color is
 that is a flesh colored crayon ladies and gentlemen I don't know let's test that
 yep kind of what's tested again
 at the same as it was sitting right there in the last class did exactly that and went that's rude and it is the crane company made the Assumption prior to 1962 that anybody who bought that crayon box for their kid and their kid who wanted to color in their coloring book characters with faces that look like them well this was the flash color
 good after use the brown one sorry you know to their Everlasting credit before the Civil Rights Act before the Voting Rights Act the kids toy company figure it out
 that they got it wrong and they took they didn't take the cran out they change the label I think they called it pasty white guy from Minnesota I don't know they called it peach or something but the credit they got the idea and you can content analyze even children's toys with an eye toward learning something about cultural assumptions make sense I paid 20 bucks for this box of crayons on eBay because they were in mint condition I used to have that I'd stolen out of this church Sunday school cran box it was a flood colored cran but now I got the real thing
 content analysis generating inside from information that's out there but not necessarily out there just for you
 finally a way of conducting research using other people's data that I will tell you now is pretty much the most common way we conduct research in sociology it is certainly the type of research that gets published in the best journals because now if if I wanted to
 if I work at a large read at a much larger research University like let's say the University Wisconsin University of Texas if I wanted to get tenure there I would have to get a large Grant and if I was a survey researcher I would have to somehow convince the National Science Foundation or something like that to give me a half a million dollars and then let my University would let me spend two years doing a national study or I would randomly sample let's say 5000 American adults and get information about their religion about their personal habits you know about the educational level in all manners of other things they believe in about their take on Healthcare abortion roll manners of things and then I would make that available to other researchers well that is done every year by the national opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago that's been in business since 1972
 and they are funded by Grant grants from among other places National Science Foundation General Social Survey and you can get essentially they get two or three thousand people every year to answer a couple thousand questions they conduct some interviews and all this is available who out there is is sick enough including me to want to know the percentage of Baptist vs Presbyterian that watch pornography
 anybody sick enough to want to know that okay just me nevermind
 but you can do that
 do you have access to General Social Survey now the very first piece of research that was ever published with my name on it was a piece that we went out a 1994 it's by far the piece that's gotten the most attention from other Scholars it's been cited more than any other thing I've ever been a part of writing and it had to do with religion and health comparisons to buy scent is religion help hell for anglos and non nine angles of a piece that's been out for a while but that was that was collected by some guy the University of Michigan and then you just put it up on what was at that time it's version of the internet
 so will you secondary data data that somebody else collected and that covers in a lot of ways the validity problem with survey research are you really getting an answer the question you asked well if you random sample you've got an argument that you are that we're looking at them to can we say something about the entire US population by getting information from two thousand people if you get the right two thousand people and select them correctly yes you can sew it solves a problem but you can't get any more you can't you can't infer anything else from it other than you learned about college students at those colleges and at that time
 so that's got some that's got some applicability issues related to on the other hand quite frankly nobody else on planet Earth has survey data on the religiousness of people with religious tattoos for whatever that's worth now there may come a day when somebody has secondary data built in fact my partner in this whole religious tattoo project dr. Doherty from Taylor has a colleague who gave him a jump drive at a meeting that has a nationally representative sample of American adults that he got with a huge Grant from the National Science Foundation and it has a tattoo question on it do you have a tattoo
 well we can take that and start looking at other religious variables and so on and are able to say this represents America not this represents 12 college campuses so we're moving there Connecticut that sell secondary data my research partner and friend happened to be having lunch with a guy that had just gotten this data set through a huge grin and because he has an interest in what we're doing kindly said to my colleague home here's a jump drive with the data that we went
 thank you very very much
 and that's the next thing we're going to be riding and a nobody yet has written anything about tattoos especially tattoos and religion where they do use that kind of a data set so it just this how it goes into just how it goes these days secondary analysis content analysis questions
 the culture piece for Thursday's way more interesting than this technical crap okay just bear with me
 what do you do with this work you send
 I love being a college professor in part because I Love College I loved it when I was there I went three different graduate schools cuz I loved it so much I get to write papers and go to class and exchange ideas
 you write papers going to class exchange ideas and you have to put up with getting graded right so the Wii and it's not easy
 I wrote a piece probably a 6 or 7 page double spaced short little research note on religion and Tattoos about 10-12 years ago and I sent it off to a journal to be peer-reviewed know what that means is when you don't people like me write a research these gone do all this stuff and we want to publish right to send it to the I don't know three people that have jobs just like me or four times a year I get invitations from Journal editors review this piece and I do that when you get when you get a return from the editor after you submit an article they say it but we're going to publish it as is that is never happened to me I only had Emily had to happen once
 out of all that all of my work that it got published in the first journal to which I submitted it that's only happened once you usually get a rejection excuse me a rejection which is like getting a d where you get an invitation to revise and resubmit which is very much like getting a B minus
 you say that you know the other two will send it back and say the reviewers have said this this this in this and we double dog dare you to fix it
 the seven pages double-spaced article I sent you a journal got returned to me with eight pages of single-spaced critique
 and the editor said the reviewers have some serious concerns about your work but you know what we doubled area to fix it and you can revise it in the challenge accepted
 and it took about a year really because I kept looking through the critique and going cuz I thought it was perfect when I sent it out I really did
 and I'm going
 point taken I guess you know I mean they found out where it sucked and then I went on and on about it
 but it made the paper better and that's going to happen to you for the next four years in college if you're in your first year you're going to turn stuff into people like me and we're going to tell you where it's sucked
 and some of the crueler of us are going to go on and on about it a little bit
 but the point of that is to try to make it better and to try to sharpen your way of thinking you always do something for the first time terribly in fact I don't care in seminary teaching us how to be gentle caregiver types Hospital types his main motto was anything worth doing is worth doing what
 we're doing is worth doing badly
 I tell all of my graduate students who write a thesis for me give me five really terrible pages and we'll start from there and I usually and I'm not kidding
 revise and resubmit keep making it better get better every day that's what it's subjecting your work is all about and it will happen to you and there's a kinship there I really like the exchange of ideas I will tell you that just because of my own emotional makeup the hardest thing for me to do is to confront a revise and resubmit
 when I get a rejection actually that's easier because I'll take a few of the things that they said that was wrong with it and fix it quickly and send it somewhere else
 but a revise and resubmit means I have to confront the serious limits of what they think is a paper that has some Merit
 almost every time I get a revise and resubmit the thinks it's on my desk for a month before I work up the nerve to go confront where it sucked just part of how it goes
 and being persistent is what will enable you to succeed in college you just keep knocking on the door you might as well let me in because I'm going to stay here till you do revise and resubmit
 questions
 okay I have two more pieces in this presentation today one of the ethical issues in research and the other is not on the outline it's a Greg Abbott piece I'm going to talk to you about what Greg Abbott is about and how we're going to do that
 everything you do
 is subject to the ethical question and there's really only one at the go question in the entire universe that is because we can do it
 should we
 because we can should we
 32 Hallmarks of ethical research of social research anyway or at the very least confidentiality preserving the confidentiality or anonymity of your subjects and if you and I had a conversation about your rear the religion that would not be anonymous I would know you but if I were to publish the content of that interview in comparison to others I would keep your name out of it that's called confidentiality Hallmark of ethical research informed consent
 if you're going to be a lab rat we have to tell you an at-will first we have to ask your permission
 and nobody has to be a lab rat without that you have to give your consent and we also have to tell you up front and in Vivid terms how doing this might harm you and that's obvious in medical research
 It's oddly obvious in Social research and it took me a while to figure this out
 based in large part on laud Humphreys Tearoom trade without building to add a minute every College in every University and that includes this one has what's called an Institutional review board or a committee for the protection of human subjects the College of Arts and Sciences at this university has a very high-powered IRB college has the same thing before you recruit research subjects for any reason you have to submit the proposal to the IRB and the IRB has to sign off on it why is that
 I've been conducting these Anonymous questionnaires forever and very early on the IRB was giving me some trouble and I was annoyed because I can get annoyed and that's when I reveal how stupid I am General
 I wanted to know why do we worry about what's on the questionnaire even if we're asking personal questions we ask extraordinary personal question if it's scrupulously protocol does anonymous who cares I learned
 second or third question are we put together on tattoos and other behaviors every question are we've ever done has this question on it at what age did you first experience sexual intercourse question and of course a lot of people said never not yet and then other things that sort of thing but you would never sit down and face-to-face ask that question but you can ask him anonymously and I'm going why don't have to go through the whole who have IRB just because these are personal questions I got the answer
 one of our questionnaires
 W backtrack a minute before you actually give a questionnaire to a group like this for real you put your pretest it with a smaller group and I was teaching a junior-level class on alcohol and drugs and society and I had the Freshman question I was going to give I said you guys take this I'm not interested in what the answers are I'm interested in your reaction to the questions are they clear to the next sense. Ambiguous in any way that question was on it so I got back these pretest and I wanted I should write on the margins tell us whatever you think somebody wrote nine I was raped oh happy day I bet taking our questionnaire just made your day you know this person wasn't expecting that and I went oh this is why we warn them
 and on every question are we've ever distributed and collected since we have put in the informed consent information first of all you don't have to do this at all
 secondly if you do we need to warn you among other things that this may bring about some unpleasant memories and if that happens and if that bothers you hear our resources for it we put questions on other question areas of people have ever been the victim of abuse with people have ever considered suicide and so on in addition to the to the sex question and in R-12 School survey the eye Arby's at all the schools and made us put into the questionnaire on the suicide question think about killing yourself right after that question we put have to put down the National Suicide Hotline number we want you to have that right now when we talked about the abuse question but the national abuse hotline number we put the local student Counseling Center number and address in it is right then when perhaps it called back memories that's called in for
 consent this may hurt you this may cause you some emotional pain and if it does he react because I handle it or you don't have to play at all and no problem no no difficulty whatever
 all of this stuff we have to do because in part what laud Humphreys did wrong. Humphreys wrote his doctoral dissertation at Washington University in St Louis in the early sixties and it was entitled Tearoom trade what's a Tearoom what does it mean to trade their Humphries was interested in doing participant observation research and documented what he knew to be true that in public parks in St Louis in the early 60s
 two 3 in the morning man would come to the bathrooms and meet other men for anonymous speed sex that was called Tea Room trading index Factor right there right now Humphreys just wanted to study this and documented
 add up to a point so far so good he actually was known to the two-room Traders as a lookout he called it a watch queen and you needed one of those because the behavior is illegal in 1964 two reasons why did violate sodomy laws to there's a public indecency question on that they're both against the law for doing the T room trading know he's there and know why he's there okay
 what they don't know and never did was it Humphreys jot it down license numbers
 now you can't say for sure that the registered owner of the car is the Tearoom traitor but there's a pretty close correlation get the idea so he's first of all violated in a way that could be extraordinary really dangerous especially for guys in 1960 in St Louis. Public parks in that he took this list of names that he got from a friend he had the Saint Louis police department and he gave that list of names to another graduate student who was sort of behind him you know Junior graduate student I'm at grad student was conducting just demographic research she was going door-to-door at this time every we are doing this with computers doing that Survey Monkey in those days
 going door-to-door just collecting demographic data how old are you how many people are in your family what religion are you you know what's your income that kind of thing you just collecting demographic in different areas of St Louis 20 people in your study
 so now he has information not only that they're tearing Traders he knows a lot about right you know it's more than that he knows where they live where they live with how much money they make what kind of jobs that have etcetera etcetera huge violation of informed consent they don't have a clue
 that they have been outed in Humphreys mine right why would he do this what he learned and this is sort of the ends justify the means and it's up to you to decide that he learned that the majority is Tearoom Traders were in general White
 married Catholics with children
 who know well now we all know
 was it worth it who would say that was worth knowing back then
 who would say this was a horrible violation of trust
 so if you want with me at night and I agree there were shoving matches in the hallways of Washington University in St Louis between professors over whether or not unfreeze should get his doctoral dissertation or whether he should be expelled for violating these codes of Ethics none of this stuff was in place there was no IR beer committee for the protection of human subjects at Washington at that time but it's in part because of that kind of research that we have them now so anonymity informed consent let him know where it might hurt you now you can do research like that and you can conduct it in ways that are ethical
 and it during its efforts and sunsets of people know they're being studied and if you warn them they're being studied sometimes I act differently so there's a there's a problem with that
 but it's way more complicated than you think even behind the questionnaire invitations that you get through your email you know when a chance at a $20 Amazon card to Starbucks card or something if you answer these questions there's a whole lot more behind that and you as consumers of research
 should ask yourself what's in it for me what risks are there and are they telling me the whole story you should be informed consumers of even the question or the invitation to become a lab rat fair enough
 anonymity confidentiality informed consent
 the Tearoom trade and you've been given an opportunity to read about the Tearoom trade and you can check the book out of the library Tech Library has it
 okay one last thing
 for the first and only time this semester I'm going to tell you that Thursday two days from now September 12th will be Greg Abbott day there will be four points in play if you are here on Thursday. What do you have to do well glad you asked
 we are tasked by the governor and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to assess your ability to communicate now there's not a chance in the world that I can assess all of your abilities to communicate but I can randomly select one of you and test that
 on the board there's something that's called the announcers test that goes back to the 1940s and if you wanted a job at Radio City Music Hall in New York you had to be able to read and recite this exercise in memory and diction two ducks three squawking geese for Limerick oysters five corpulent porpoises six pairs of Don alverzo tweezers 7000 macedonians in full battle 8 brass monkeys from the ancient sacred Crypts of Egypt nine apathetic sympathetic diabetic old men on roller skates with a marked propensity towards procrastination and sloth and 10 lyrical spiritual diabolical of The Quay of the quivery all at the same time
 now
 on Thursday since I have a class list and there's a number in front of each of your names and I have a random number generator on the computer I'm going to randomly generate 10 numbers between 1 and 278 and a list of 10 randomly selected students and at the end of class on Thursday I'm going to go down that list until I find one of the Ten of you who is willing to stand up where you sit and recite that or read it I should say off the board who thinks they might be willing to do that and if one person one randomly-selected person in this room will do that everybody gets two of the four Greg Abbott points everybody who's here
 but wait there's more
 if any of you between now and then and my microphone just died if any of you between now and then feel you can memorize that and a willing to come down where I'm standing turn around and face the crowd and is there more than one of you will have a choir
 and recite it to a 70% accuracy cuz that's the gold standard in American Education everybody gets the other two points so a randomly-selected reciter and another self-selected hero
 can get us four points up before you go before you go hold on hold on hold on how hard is this I have a video of
 my at the time
 6 year old granddaughter
