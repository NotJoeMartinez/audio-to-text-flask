good morning everybody the entry music I try to make at least a modest attempt to have some of it fit the topic of the day and if you've never heard of a 1960s protest song that was Joan Baez singing at Woodstock the song called Joe Hill a tribute to basically dead coal miners about the organization of the United Mine Workers and so on and sometimes it's sort of a sort of opaque and oblique but that was it today okay
what why do you never see elephants in trees
 you never see elephants why is that are really good at hiding in trees
 okay that my dad would have been proud of that
 to this point are there any questions about details or Logistics
 any questions about what the course is about with the syllabus is about
 let me give you an early heads up exam one the first test in this class will be two weeks from today and I will cover the other five topics that that are in this sector and multiple choice questions like I promised on the syllabus but you should write in your planner September 17th two weeks from today that's when test one will occur and I'll be a review session for the afternoon prior at 4 in the mask on building and that's on the review sheet just give me an early heads up
 that's the review session the test will be in this room at this hour all of our tests including the final will be in this room
 bring the Crank It Up
 play your sort of writing the study guide by taking notes in class that's what the outline is all about and if you have gaps or questions about what was what was presented under videos topics the review session is a good time to clear that up
 other questions
 okay promised you that this lecture and Thursdays lecture would be the backbone of the class
 how do I go through and Define and lay out and distinguish one from the other two three theoretical perspectives three ways of looking at life
 three ways to be right actually these are not either or mutually exclusive categories these are ways of thinking
 a theory and most academic disciplines even engineering have Theory courses this is what we think about this is what we imagine is going on here the technical definition of a theory
 it's just an educated guess
 educated guess
 25 grad student is writing a thesis at this point and she's looking at the relationship between religion and a lot of other things
 and as she is developing a theory about the relationship between religion and well-being
 Cherokee is it initially that religion produces a kind of connection for people in their world
 she also argues that religion sort of disincentivizes being
 being self-destructive religion reduces drinking and drugging religion draws people together she also I think rightly is pointing out that religion sometimes stigmatizes people so there's a mixed relationship between religion and well-being that's your theory it draws people together and keep people in line but it also creates out-groups so that's a theory to guess what I'm going to develop an outline today two of three major theoretical perspectives ways of looking at the world and talk about their assumptions and what we can learn by looking at the world through those lenses and how some of those might be tested and also some of the strengths and limits of those two
 the two theoretical perspectives were laying out today or what's called structural functionalism or a functionalist point of view
 and a social conflict point of view
 and you're going to hear all about that for the next hour and change they have one thing in common both of these perspectives operate
 at what we're calling a macro-level big picture
 these two perspectives are both at the macro level and their distinct from the one we're going to talk about on Thursday which is micro and let me let me make that distinction clear
 we're looking at life
 the two macro perspectives functionalism and conflict theory look at life in countries life in countries the relationship between income and sex men and women make different kind different levels of income access to healthcare by Anglo or other or something like that categories of people in countries is that macro-level the macro sounds like big right big macro as opposed to micro or small
 macro looks at life in countries
 micro looks at life in rooms or at most buildings like a like of a school building or restaurant or something like that. The macro-level
 which perspective
 would argue that Medicare for all reduces inequality does that sound like that's looking at life in a country or looking at life in a room
 country clearly which perspective would examine the body language of a physician in an examining room with his or her patient is that sound like it's in a country or a room that's micro okay settle today only at the mackerel are all right I want to talk about
 educated guesses of how things we know about Mike connect all right
 it would be hard to argue that there is no relationship between poverty and crime we sort of all intuitively understand that where you find one of those you tend to find the other fair enough just let's go with that assumption for a minute
 what what's the chicken and what's the egg here
 you could present a plausible argument you could take a point of view or you could imagine a perspective on that relationship like this well cry
 cause of poverty
 if you have a part of the city that's infested with illegal drugs if it's got a lot of dark alleys and there are lots of terrible things happening people one-on-one who's going to want to move their business their right
 nobody's going to have jobs crime causes poverty is a perspective
 if you want to fix that going to be a successful society and have less poverty you get tough on crime come up with more laws you lengthen mandatory sentences you build more prisons you hire more police get-tough-on-crime so that you will Levy a poverty and have a social stable world that's just an argument connected to a strategy fair enough you have to agree with that you have to buy the logic
 on the other hand
 I think you could possibly argue that poverty causes crime if there are no legitimate ways to make a living and your family is hungry and the drug dealers are hiring that's where you'll go to work right Temple
 just a different point of view poverty causes crime the remedy for that is to provide at least a level of infrastructure where basic needs could be mad reasonably furnished and staff schools reasonable access to healthcare that kind of thing we're basically distinguishing social issues like crime and poverty from personal trouble and looking at the cultural way of dealing with that Mills argued that in the sociological imagination
 social issues require associate politics and economics the politics and economics of law enforcement the politics and economics of healthcare and education
 but I just modeled for you are examples of looking at the same thing from a functionalist and a conflict point of view I'm going to put up this entire lecture in one picture actually a half a picture by showing you what I call the macro-micro triangle
 this is
 this is theory on one page and we're operating completely today on the macro level will drop down to the micro level on Tuesday but this is what this is really all this is where we're going today and that's about it
 a structural functionalist point of view asks this question
 how they both asked the same question how does a successful Society maintain order stability deficiency in consensus it's called a functionalist perspective cuz we're trying to figure out how to keep the wheels on how to keep the car running how to maintain functionality good
 I just said that from a functionalist point of view you might argue that the relationship between crime and poverty starts with crime get-tough-on-crime poverty goes away or at least as reduced stability order consensus efficiency see what that's a functionalist argument
 from a conflict point of view how does a successful Society reduce inequality why would we want to do that when there is unequal access to things everybody needs that will create fight that will cause conflict when there is unequal access to things that everybody needs like bathrooms in the south in the 50s that will cause conflict like the Civil Rights Movement get the idea so you can see how the argument
 comes out of this perspective that again when playing by the rules doesn't help or Break The Rules from the conflict point of view
 they're both looking at the same thing we want Society to succeed we want to have a successful Society question is what's in the foreground and what's in the background and it's not either or both perspectives see the value of reducing inequality both perspectives see the value of generating efficiency and stability just coming out of from different points of view
 let me ask you this question so which of these two perspectives would you argue or think is being argued let's say which perspective would take the position that medicare-for-all reduces social inequality first of all operating in a country or a room country for two perspectives that is concerned with inequality conflict which perspective would argue that medicare-for-all reduces inequality and reduces conflict is
 which perspective would take the position that medicare-for-all reduces incentives for excellence and creates a mediocre world
 that would be a functionalist point of his dysfunctional everybody gets the same thing why should we work harder right okay so that's looking at the same thing from two different points of view all right
 now the tricky part which perspective would argue in favor of medicare-for-all because it is potentially cost-effective cheaper in the long run that would be a functionalist point of view wouldn't it
 so that's first two are easy capitalism drives Excellence no medicare-for-all
 healthcare is a is a right of citizenship it reduces inequality medicare-for-all
 which perspective would argue against medicare-for-all because it gives more power to a potentially overpowering government it might create a dictatorship that's a conflict point of view the power issue I just pointed out that you could take the same issue argue in favor or against it from both perspectives are lots of ways to be right now you can distinguish them with regard to issues of social stability or social inequality let me give you another way to look at it and you may have already figured this
 and again these are not mutually exclusive but you would be more correct than not if you looked at a functionalist perspective as similar to a kind of right-wing political ideology or a red State perspective more right than not correct than not to see a functionalist perspectives that kind of right-leaning way of looking at life okay similarly and you may have figured this out a conflict point of you focusing on equality and empowerment would be more of a left-leaning blue State point of view
 again I wouldn't say always right but more right than not in terms of how you want to conceptualize it in your head make sense
 I've given you this same information that's in this picture here
 on another link on the website that simply called which sociological perspective this is a way of thinking this is a narrative for how you think through what your teacher might be saying or what a politician might be saying or what a marketer might be saying
 when you encounter a test question now I got your attention that begins which sociological perspective the first thing you should ask yourself is this macro or micro is this happening in a country where is it happening in a room and to give you a preview of Coming Attractions if it's happening in a room which is micro there's only one answer and that's interactionist if it's happening in a country which is where we're dealing today
 you have to ask a second question if it's at the macro level is it dealing with social stability
 what's that
 functionalist say it again functionalist stability
 Bratayley with a quality
 conflict and then that's how you answer the question but don't circumvent the process of micro micro so that information on this which sociological perspective
 can be brought to bear on test questions or items in the news or pretty much anything else in the macro micro triangle is a way of taking that and giving you a picture
 that essentially is functionalism and conflict theory by way of introduction are there any questions so far and how to tell these apart
 these are two perspectives that look at life in a country
 and they look at two different things they look they put stability in order in the foreground and inequality in the back room they put any quality in the foreground and stability in order in the background it's like looking at a picture of a barn in a field the barn to be in the foreground you can fish see the field behind it where you can see a picture of the field with the barn in the background that's that's the difference
 where did we get this stuff
 I give you ladies and gentlemen the dead white guys
 they would be the opposite of a boy band
 old dead white guys
 ml durkheim is by-and-large the father of functionalism
 Karl Marx is by-and-large the father of conflict theory Max Weber and don't ask me why we don't anglicize his name when we talked about it Knox Vapor feels very strongly both ways to say a lie
 miss a lot about their timing marks today and unless About Vapor though we will talk
 ml durkheim
 was a French Aristocrat and he came up with an overarching broadly-based theory of solidarity cohesion what connects individuals to their world what makes social issues or social problems more or less likely what conditions create a higher probability
 for things to happen and how do those conditions more or less be understood as cohesion and solidarity
 he wrote a book called suicide
 which sounds like a an individual thing right individuals take their own lives and they do
 it is an individual thing and psychologists study it interesting enough psychologist also even today more than a hundred and twenty years after the book was written still have their students read this
 dirt time did not ask why did this person take his or her life he asked what conditions in my world
 make the suicide rate higher or lower the rate at which this occurs the number of people per thousand in a year that in their lives what makes that go up what makes that go down and it came up with lots of social variables so let's play Who Wants to Be a Jerk I'm in let's imagine for a second two countries
 country one is experiencing economic prosperity
 unemployment's down GDP is up rate of growth is good country to is experiencing recession heading to a depression in which of these two countries in durkheim measure these variables did he find the suicide rate higher economic prosperity
 economic depression
 it turns out that that's where durkheim found the suicide rate to be slightly higher the reason a theory of solidarity and cohesion in good Economic Times more people are connected more individuals are connected to the economy got it
 in which country country Water Country 2 is the suicide rate higher country at War
 country at peace
 besides War who says peace
 it turns out Ender times day suicide rates were higher in countries at peace again the overarching theory is solidarity call it to mine this
 our country was never more united socially even politically the president's approval ratings were in the high 80% tiles on September 12th 2001 similarly December 8th 1941 because we are all in this together we have all been attacked and we draw together and resistance
 so that's the theory now one brief digression there's a rate of diminishing return on this the war that was started essentially by 9/11 has been going on for 18 years and it's created a lot of malaise and distrust and uncertainty
 and certainly among returning military personnel suicide rate started to perk up a little bit and even First Responders some ways in relation to the other kinds of violence here is to suggest that what what is what is similar in the economic question and the wartime question or maybe the political question is that solidarity and cohesion reduces suicide that's the issue that's the overarching theory couple more examples
 in which country country Water Country 2 is the suicide rate higher countries that have a higher percentage of the population who are married countries and have a higher percentage of the population that are single suicide rate marital status who says suicide is higher among countries where marriage is more prominent
 who says suicide is higher in countries where singleness is more prominent that it turns out and you're starting to get this
 being married connects an individual to a family structure a married couple has a different text category than a single person and that married couples tax category is beneficial to everybody in the society this Mary so there's that there's this connection now
 I'm going to give you one more and then I want to elaborate on the marriage thing
 one more which country one or two is the suicide rate higher countries that are predominantly Protestant
 in countries that are predominantly country to Catholic who would say the suicide rate is higher among Protestant based countries
 suicide rate higher among Catholic based countries sort of an even split here
 they are higher among Protestants as it turns out early if they were for dirt bike now that has nothing to do with what a lot of people think it serves a Catholic rule that if you take your own life it's a one way trailer to one way trip for eternity South as it were even the pope would say hey you know what I doubt it nobody knows but the issue here Catholic ritual and theology is more consistent Country Inn worldwide if for example you are Catholic and you attend Catholic mass in the Philippines or in Mexico or in Italy and you don't know the language you can still get it because the Theology and the ritual is more consistent
 Protestant Christianity is more diverse there's a greater greater issues that divided Protestants then divide Catholics
 think of it now fast forward to 2019 and think of a hardcore Southern Baptist and a left-leaning presbyterian talking about same-sex marriage or even alcohol consumption why the difference
 so the overarching theory of solidarity suggest that Catholicism has a characteristic of a country is going to have a somewhat suppressive effect on the suicide rate in ways different than protestantism being the characteristic of the country so are you what I hope you're seeing is that in each of these four instances durkheim's overarching theory of solidarity and cohesion has an effect on the suicide rate the more cohesive is the variable right being married or having a percentage of the higher percentage being married at War drawing people together economic Prosperity Catholicism is a cohesive theology
 now
 it's only been about two years maybe three that at this point in this lecture and Engineering student sitting right over there said
 what about divorce does it work the other way today I said I don't know I'll get back to you so I have this next slide which is somewhat of a digression on durkheim and suicide in honor of the student who asked what I thought was a provocative question I've got to stay estatistica sheet here to Stats divorce and suicide now
 these are the 20 States on each side that have the highest suicide rates and the highest divorce rates the number 4000 Oklahoma 44 out of a thousand for divorce also Wyoming 2.8 / 10,000 10,000 I mean for suicide these are the 10 states where the suicide rates the highest and the divorce rate is the highest the question is what's the level of overlap
 do we find more suicide among states were the divorce rate is higher interesting question you first have to know a little bit of Statistics Let's Pretend We're not talking about divorce and suicide Let's Pretend We're talking about Marbles and we have 20 green marbles in this bag and we have 20 red marbles in this bag Merry Christmas we mix them up and we reach in blind and draw out one marble from each bag at the same time if you do that 20 times by random chance you're going to get a match eight times that's just the statistical reality that's the number of you know you can run a statistical equation by random chance you're going to get eight matches well if you try to look for a correlation between divorce rates and suicide rates in the in the 20 states were their most prominent you get a match and on 12
 so where about
 30% higher
 33% higher than random chance on that so my student had a theory we tested the theory and it turns out to be the evidence is there of a disproportionately high suicide rate in states where the divorce rate is high and vice-versa is a correlation happening and we see them Associated one with another
 I was intrigued we expect 8 we get 12:33 % disproportionality
 what is Skip Weber for the moment I don't want to talk about everybody's favorite uncle Charlie
 this is the this is the reason your minister said don't take sociology considered a communist
 why marks is the earliest of these theorists of these writers whose the transition in his world from a feudal economy f a u d e f e u d a l to a capitalist economy where the most valuable resource is no longer slaves but the most valuable resource our machines and laborers and he's watching this transition industrialization producing
 a transition in the economy moving toward capitalism
 and quite frankly it scared the hell out of him
 looking through the window of the factory is the metaphor for Karl Marx's world you who had at least who made at least a good faith effort to read The Communist Manifesto
 okay some of your going into it and said you know what I don't get it
 right fair enough translated into English
 Mark's is the father of conflict theory largely because of basically the first line of that were the history of humankind is the history of class struggle conflict theory Marx pointed out that there were two kinds of people in this world and called them the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and he basically concluded and this is the donkey and these are the high points of the Communist Manifesto he basically concluded that not only have different interests
 but those different interests are irreconcilable they are they work at literally cross-purposes one to another
 the workers are the bourgeoisie proletariat those who own the means of production are the bourgeoisie they are in contact in the factory and they are inevitably in conflict because their interests are so diametrically opposed
 that's nice. How do I explain that the question
 wouldn't try to put this in microcosm and I have a little skit here I have skits throughout my lectures we're going to pretend I work for you
 for a lucky me huh
 we're going to pretend that you own a company called Consolidated dip widgets and in the 19th century a dip widget was the 21st century equivalent of the smartphone everybody wants one everybody's got to have one it is the most valuable thing you can keep in your pocket a dip widget all right have any idea what it did that's my job for you I take a widget and I connect it to a dip wakil and make a dip widget and move on you sell dip widgets right now economics 101 it cost you something to employ me wages benefits
 but more importantly overhead right you got mortgage to pay on the factory building you got maintenance and upkeep you got people that work in the office that don't make things but they keep track of things like how much workers cost
 there's an overhead charge that can be attached to every worker right and the worker covers that overhead charged by making the product that you sell and that's how it goes all right let's start with this assumption I punch in to work at 7 a.m. and I have worked in factories I know how this works I punch in at 7 a.m. and I start making dip which is just like always right and I work all day Monday I work all day Tuesday and all day Wednesday so three full days of it that's 24 hours of work already and at 10 on Thursday at 3 hours that's 27 hours worth of work I have made enough dip widgets such at you and I are even the money you get from selling those 27 hours worth of dip with covers my overhead
 so that means the next hour from 10 until 3:30 and all day Friday I'm still making dip widgets and you sell those and what do we call that money
 the call that profit course your job is to maximize profit and report it to stockholders right you decide that your workers are not working fast enough you've already tried feeding us and it didn't work
 actually Mark saw a lot of literal beatings in the workplace so you decide and you bring in a motivational speaker one of these to know storytelling types that get us Aunt over dip witches we believe in the value of death widgets and we're motivated to work harder and it works
 I can buy the next week and I start cranking out the app widgets and I but I start to believe I get it in my bones that this is a that this is something valuable Tuesday and by 2 on Wednesday hour and a half earlier in a full work day I am at the same level I've made my made that same amount of dip widgets
 what amounts to four and a half hours earlier right wow what what does that mean that's four and a half hours of Labor
 the result of which was more profit
 are you
 there's the punchline to The Communist Manifesto
 the harder I work
 the better he does
 end of story
 Marx argued that workers cannot improve themselves by the only thing they can do and that is work harder it doesn't help
 it might you might decide to give me a raise but you don't have to you might decide to improve my working conditions with the extra money and get but you don't have to you've got all the power I cannot Empower myself from working harder that's the irreconcilable difference in Marx's view of the relationship between labor and capital that make sense
 where can I get the only way out of this is a collective bargaining and the Communist Manifesto is really the first of the theoretical treatises that leads to the rationale for Trade union and I could sit down. You know it would be reasonable maybe for us to say you know what you're making let's say $150 of extra profit per hour * 6 hours whatever that is let's let's split the work but the point is not what those numbers are
 but that we sat down together and work it out so that both of us agreed that this is the right way to go right now I will point out that the factory life that Mark saw in the mid-to-late 1800s is exactly the same Factory life that you can go look at in a lot of the countries were a lot of the products including the smartphones are made and that the issue with regard to labor and capital is the same reason I say that is because we're on
 the capitalism has within it the seeds of its own destruction not in the US we have labor laws that protect the abuse to a degree of the kind of thing that Mark saw and was horrified by what are a lot of other countries where a lot of the things that we buy are made in a call most exactly the same way capitalism has not died in his lifetime he would see capitalism and because workers would wise up
 the only thing a worker can do to try to negotiate power is to stop working
 which seems at cross-purposes to their interests right
 marks was baffled at why I mean the slogan that comes out of the Communist Manifesto
 they didn't and we have child labor sweatshops across the world making the things that we buy
 why is this not happening we had the answer and it led to the one thing if any of the people you know know one single thing about Karl Marx this is probably it that he said loudly
 and with a great deal of Anguish religion is the opiate of the people
 religion is what's keeping capitalism in business
 what
 Mark's did not illustrate it this way to give you what I think is a fairly accessible
 window into his thinking you're reasonably familiar with the Christian New Testament in the stories of Jesus of Nazareth who's reasonably familiar with those in Matthew's gospel which is the of the four stories of Jesus life is more directed toward a Jewish audience
 you find the story of what is collectively known as the story of the rich man and Lazarus who's heard of this story the rich man and Lazarus Castle Lazarus full of sores is at his gate he lives with the dogs and they feed on the scraps that fall from the rich man's table that's the set gun last very long cuz both the rich man and Lazarus died and in the story they in effect switch places
 Lazarus has gone to Abraham's bosom you can see why this is the Jewish gospel he's held safe in the arms of Father Abraham the patriarch the rich man straight to hell do not pass go do not collect $200 and in the story they can see each other and they can have a conversation and the rich man's eternal life is so bad that he says Father Abraham don't even address the Lazarus cuz Lazarus is the favored child here
 Father Abraham tell Lazarus just to dip his finger in cool water and touch my tongue that would make it better you know that's how bad it is
 Father Abraham says sorry you had the good life on Earth
 and now you have the bad life for a hell of a lot longer
 Lazarus you basically abused him in the life he has and now he is here safely for eternity
 and it was the logic of that theology that led Marx to say religion is the opiate of the people what is he mean by that
 it means that religion
 essentially teaches people in who are suffering
 that suffering is Noble
 that suffering man fact make eternal life better for you I mean who knows what's going to happen or not but this raises the odds
 and for Mark's who had no truck much with Heaven or Hell or much religion
 he argued that all this does is give diplock a guy over there a license to Kill
 it gives him a license to abuse at legitimates the oppression of the worker cuz the worker will put up with it
 believing that it will actually make his chances for an eternal life better
 it lulls them to sleep get drugs them into submission
 religion legitimate suppression with the idea that the more you suffer on Earth the better off you might be in heaven in the odds are higher that you'll get there that make sense
 that's just the logic of his argument and that's where that statement comes from
 4 marks
 collective bargaining negotiations the only way out and free from it from his point of view religion keeps workers from trying to get to the bargaining table
 because it argues you're better off if you don't try to get to the bargaining table just try to get into heaven put up with it as it work
 questions about durkheim and a theory of solidarity and cohesion
 Marx about a conflict theory of Oppression negotiation and collective bargaining
 got questions
 let me point out one of the thing I forgot to mention I put on the class web page helius and Haley now have office hours that you know of they had them for a while and I just posted them this morning
 these are drop-in X Delia says in his office on Wednesday from 1:30 to 2:30 and Friday from 9 to 11 it's not drink Tuesday and Thursday so that's generally helpful Haley is in there in her office at those hours in and I'm on Tuesday and Thursday before my 9:30 class
 let's talk about Max Weber for a minute
 vapor is the one that's riding toward the end of
 and he's also watching the same things happened he's watching industrialization generate a capitalist dominated economy and he's wondering why that is an interesting ly enough he comes up with the same answer that marks came up with that is religion but in a very different way for a very different reason and to a much more in his point of view positive affect how most of us kind of know what the Protestant ethic is work hard play fair do better that's sort of what it means work hard play fair do better where did this come from
 well Weber was well-schooled in Christian theology his father was a Protestant minister
 and he was aware that
 the idea of Heaven and Hell created anxiety who's going to get there how do I get there what do I have to do
 will they ever was also well schooled in the Theology of John Calvin one of the major players in the Protestant Reformation coming out of the early 1500s John Calvin is arguably the father of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland tradition and Calvin has a Doctrine that's widely known and grievously misunderstood but that everybody was sort of aware of in Vapors time the doctrine of predestination
 Vapor again being a sort of individual depressive self understood that the question of what happens to me after I die is a compelling question and produces some anxiety
 John Calvin's doctrine of predestination answers the question
 and the question is nobody knows
 nobody can know and it's already been decided before the beginning of time God who created the heavens and the earth made a list and created the people who ever would be born for all time that would be one of the elect that would be elected to to be saved
 and all Calvin meant by that was that nobody knows what God will do well duh
 that's still true
 nobody knows I mean nobody knows for certain
 Weber argued that when people aren't sure about something they look for Clues
 is it I Lord and Weber argued essentially that doing well and being good
 and playing Fair
 tended to generate a good life
 maybe not the best life but a good life
 and that he argued alleviated the anxiety because how can I not be one of God's elect I'm doing so well now will take the next life not for granted but we'll certainly look at this as a clue
 so people began to Weber argued in again this is way more simplified than the book which is really really hard to read
 doing well and being good we're signs of you lack these were clues that you were on the list and it alleviated anxiety was sort of like whistling in the dark through a graveyard you know am I going to get through this well yeah I'm doing okay
 now my dissertation advisor my mentor at Purdue University was a boot-licking Bavarian if you called him up in the morning and see what are you having for breakfast then I'll figure it out you know that's basically is life and so my not retired colleague. Robert tonight and the religious tattoo you know that what people told us about the religious tattoos sort of smelled like neighbor in a way that would we ask people to write down the story the religious tattoo and a lot of them had religious tattoos that they got in memory of people they love who had died and that was a connection we thought to the afterlife in one sense a lot of them I got religious tattoos either is a sign of conversion to a religion which would put you on the list maybe or a sign of amendment of life
 currently now in my tattoo says that the the most Vivid example of of anybody that describe the religious tattoo for us
 the one thing that they told us that made Vivid sense to us in one sentence or says it work this it was a male who said I got it I got this religious tattoo when I lost my virginity is a recommitment to Purity and Corset tattoo is permanent
 it's the logic of favors argument that we tried to make a little bit more accessible to students so that's why I didn't charge you anything for it so take it for that but I think it's interesting Weber and Marx especially are looking at the same thing and essentially explain it with the same reality religion but in very very different ways and that's the essence of comparative perspectives I think if you learn nothing else about Weber and Marx look at how they look at the same thing came up with the same answer but for very very different reasons and I think that's the art of critical thinking fair enough
 any questions again about durkheim suicide in solidarity
 Mark's collective bargaining religion is legitimating a pressione capitalism as having within it the seeds of its own destruction yes sir
 people's capitalism known about all the atheists that's still working terrible job that are Lowry terrible pay the atheist that work total hours are terrible pay I think that this is what distinguishes macro from micro I think that it would be hard to argue that any workplace in the United States is situated in a country that's rather deeply and conspicuously Christian and whether you buy it the ideology is out there and whether you can make a difference
 you work at a place that's driven by that even if you don't believe it and so you're stuck with it right and then I think there's been a lot of sort of anti religious social movements certainly the struggle for gay rights has a component of it that's very much anti-religious because religiousness as sort of a pressed that particular category
 good question others
 what I next have for you in your study guide are actually two pages of lecture notes functionalism and conflict theory in Greater detail these are literally lecture notes I'm going to try to come to talk through briefly functionalist view of society view of human nature and sort of functionalist sociology and the same for conflict theory
 from a structural functionalist point of view and oh I want to tell you another thing just separate for second cuz this is a visual
 for the rest of the semester I'm going to try and I've gotten a depth at this any time I'm talking about functionalism per se or talking about a functionalist view on something like family or education son I'm going to drift over to this side of the room
 and that from your point of view is which side of the room that's the right side that's the right wing so when I'm talking with you if you if you lost if you if you've lost track of where things were you got a text and answered it and you look up and you wonder what the heck is going on if I am over on this side of the room chances are we're talking about something related to functionalist thought similarly if I'm going to talk about conflict theory per say or bring to bear a conflict perspective on something I'm going to drift over here to the left-wing I really want you to get this stuff it's really the only thing it's the skeleton that I hope you take out of here that you can put flash on in different ways when you encounter other things in your life
 and since I've got a little bit of a break in the action here let me put in a plug I really think and I thought this group for four decades that sociology might be the best minor you could be fine and I get why you might want to major in engineering or business or something where you can make more money and you don't use your skills in a different way but I think what we have to teach you the insights that we would bring to bear Irrelevant in any other thing you might take so just put in a plug if you if you thinking about a minor you're not quite sure at least give us a look cuz I think it would it would enhance your view of whatever the things as well now that was not an unbiased opinion thank you very much but take it for that all right
 turn off functionalist point of view it's almost like we're trying to create a giant machine where the gears all interlock right all these social institutions that I introduced you to with C Wright Mills Family religion education government Healthcare economy they really should work together and they are the source of connecting individuals to society this is a whole solidarity a successful Society will have an education system that schools and trains and provide skills that are needed in the economy
 a successful Society will have family values and maybe religious ideologies are certainly moral philosophy that maintain the general goodness of people who will work hard, play fair all these things should connect the Healthcare System should function with the government in the economy somehow good luck with that but anyway that's the idea of a functionalist view of society successful societies provide these interlocking mechanism so that individuals can connect OK institutions create equilibrium social change evolves because it needs to be more deliberate morality is basically what we all agree that it is and we'll talk about that in more detail when I pick up the deviants Topic in the next segment
 that's the start of the view of society
 from a functionalist point of view looking at individuals arguing that basically we are naturally competitive left your own devices we will try to win
 fresh salads
 because that energy creates the survival of the fittest as it were sort of an evolutionary kind of point of view people are fundamentally different people are different worth not necessarily more or less work but not everybody should try to go to college and not everybody should try to go to medical school we have a lot of other things that need doing ask yourself who do I need first when my toilet overflows do I need a neurosurgeon or do I need a plumber
 and I'd be willing to Pam just about the same with you
 all right
 I wanted to go to medical school I wrote an eighth grade career book on being dr. Cooke that's what I am just not very helpful one although I did T I was on the faculty adjunct faculty the med school teaching a course on physician and Society with a whole team of people so I called my mom up at the time I said finally
 she was so proud the mechanics of dealing with people in that setting I'm fairly good at it was fairly good at it as a Chaplain and a pastor I just don't know squat about science and I hate it
 so you know I taking biology in college and the thing that killed me about biology as you were supposed to look at a worm or something underneath the microscope and I couldn't look at it cuz my glasses banged into the thing so I take my glasses off which is fine you can adjust it look see adjust with my head up but my glasses back on at which point ADHD kicks in I'm going what if I just see I have no idea
 you know that kind of thing sedation reduction equation and events Advanced chemistry equation do you actually understand it
 yeah nobody really I mean if you understand if you like the fourth person I've met in three of them to the faculty that actually get it so anyway I'll write what your deal is and then work your way in have a terrible story about this fortunately it's not about me it's about one of my buddies from grad school Dave was a boot-licking durkheim and what do you have for breakfast I don't know if I'll find out
 he really thought that if people play by the rules and work hard they would do fine and he and I got out of grad school about the same time I've landed this gig and he got a job at a very small
 conservative Baptist School in Tennessee which have very different expectations of Faculty at the same school by the same people to do our work in the same way I got a wonderful fit Dave's not so much
 Dave's job required him to have a lot of FaceTime with students lots of office hours lots of hand-holding from Dave's point of view and we were on a plane when we met in a tall tale of replacing replying to a conference so we're talking on the plane as well how's it going where you already said that's a great couple of weeks ago was late in the day I was tired and I've been having this steady stream of students coming in and whining about how the readings were too hard and there was too much to do and I don't get this and finally he said one kid asked one stupid question too many and this is Dave being pejorative there are no stupid questions if you don't know the answer the only stupid questions when you don't ask any way Dave says
 I just slammed my book down and looked him in the eye and said pal in this world there needs to be people at flip burgers and fried chicken and you're it
 I said oh really is what happened then he said I got a letter from the Provost as I bet you did and he said I am starting to look for another job anyway just got another job he's had a couple of them he's done great work but he didn't belong there other kinds of people belong there a point of a functionalist view of society find your spot where you can be who you are and that's the good thing
 we look at data we use the scientific method we try to
 examine how college entrance exams would help
 making sure or at least raising the odds that the people who get to College belong there deregulating let the market create what is and what should be
 get tax breaks to churches painted churches and other nonprofits to stay in business because they sort of create this moral fabric that makes descent and crime less like churches in nonprofits have a really good deal in this country they don't pay any sales tax don't want to have to fill out some forms but the most important thing is that people who give money to church as a non-profit don't pay any income tax on that money so if you at some point in your life give $100,000 let's say to a college or a church or something. Nonprofit it's in effect only costing you about $70,000 because you're not paying 30% of that in taxes and it benefits the nonprofit
 what's functionalism in in detail questions
 those are just my lecture notes
 conflict theory in detail
 again Mark's saw the defining image in his world as the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the engine of societies class struggle the history of humankind is the history of class struggle that's the essence of conflict theory where resources are scarce resources that everybody needs like healthcare and education people will fight for it
 and to reduce conflict you make it more available in some way
 conflict theory says that left to our own devices we would Co-op I'm sorry I'm missing one we can judge a successful Society with regard to how much its GDP has increased in the last 10 years but institutions create Humane conditions
 and it is morally is morally legitimate to challenge social social institutions that perpetuate inequality how well do we do with the least the Lost in the lab would be a question coming out of a conflict orientation in an analysis of our society
 left to our own devices we would be cooperative and I think there's some evidence for that you know when something like a hurricane or a terrorist attack or something of Plano really impacts all of us we really do dry together left to our own devices this is our nature as it were
 4 shaped by what we do this comes out of marxist writings as well that not only when we go to work are we charged with a task we're also
 generating in our own view of ourselves and identity it's not just I am a 65 year old white guy I am a professor part of my identity and that's what I sort of put on you know when I put on a sport coat sky like this is like my lab coat you know something like that is how I know that I'm in character and I'm identified with with this work at I'm connected to higher ed in my world
 we can always improve ourselves we can always improve our relationships with others we can be less contentious before if we live under conditions where cooperation
 is enabled by reasonable access to it everybody needs otherwise I'm going to hit you over the head for that for that aspirin or for that Ibuprofen you know
 for that flu shot
 we study classes conflict theory really is where the study of diversity kicks in for us we study the causes and consequences of not just diverse subgroups but how diverse subgroups are ranked and in some sense empowered or disempowered is it work and the struggle for women's rights minority rights and so on I mean it's it's no more complicated than I think I mentioned this before if everybody needs a bathroom in a public place
 and you live in the south in 1950 and you are not white and the only bathroom say white only
 you're going to have to start a war
 2 basically function as a human being and that's essentially what happened
 okay
 let's recap
 this is macro theory in microcosm don't you love that
 this really is something that you could print out and and and a magnet to your refrigerator
 we're looking at three theoretical perspectives two of which we have laid out today operating at the level of looking at life in a country
 how does a successful Society maintain order stability and consensus what's what we call that perspective
 say it loud one more time last time alright okay what do we call the inequality 1
 one more time say it loud
 raiderpower who went to the game
 who thought of your sociology professor at the national anthem
 I will pick up my grocery on Thursday we're going to talk about people in a room in a building thank you very much
