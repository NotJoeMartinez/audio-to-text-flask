good morning everybody how's the mic volume in the back
 hold it look up quit texting hold on everybody good all right
 all the stuff you've heard about drinking and drugging or bad for you Joe Walsh is still alive
 I'm just playing music I like and if you like music better than what I like and you would like me to play it bring it up what I do
 if you are here for the first time this is where everything starts this is my homepage it tells a little bit about me and our department everything else but it's got this magic Introduction to Sociology link from which you get the syllabus handouts and readings the audio from last Tuesday is up there and this will be up later today or tomorrow this is the handouts and reading page and this is the study guide that gives you all at the lecture outlines and by filling in notes as I'm speaking you create your own study guide fair enough
 you should have all found that and you should be somewhere connected or close to this page in preparation for today's lecture heading also read the stuff that was available to does anybody have any procedural or logistical questions at this point anything that wasn't clear from Tuesday that I can clear up before we do anything else
 I'm going to ask that question at the start of every lecture and it's a very good time to clear up a question you have about content or about procedure I'll probably an start announcing next time when the date of the first test is it it's on the syllabus you should take those test dates and put them into your planners and set yourself a reminder etcetera okay
 I have a prop for today's lecture I didn't know I had a profit I walked in was on my Podium you know that rule that you probably are still scratching your head about like there's no excuse absences and I don't want to hear about you and your doctor cuz it's none of my business on my Podium when I walked in here
 the medical excuse from somebody all I know is the name of the student and that apparently he went to a doctor on 8/28 and was cleared to return to school on 8/29 I know what doctor it is none of my business this is the stuff just gets laying around so that's the risk it better come back when you are and you can always catch up on what happened in the class by listening to the audio I mentioned in passing that my dad a couple years ago at Thanksgiving and to sort of Honor his memory cuz I miss him and I expect if you're away from school away from home you might miss your Dad's too I'm going to try to throw a dad joke
 end of the start of class just to kind of set set the tone cuz I think the tone needs to be set and dad jokes are awesome and that my dad was the king of the dad jokes and I'm going to start the process by telling you his favorite dad joke in my life I've heard this joke a thousand times anytime something would come up and somebody tell a joke a kid so you know you only see two geese flying in a V like that you know everybody got that you ever wonder why one side of that V is always longer than the other side you ever wonder why that is no Dad why is more geese on that one
 he was the king of the dad joke so you know
 has it worked all right today is the whole course in one lecture
 sort of like the disclaimer guy at the end of the pharmaceutical commercial where they start talking like this this this isn't you know that that's kind of what we're going to do today we're going to give you the whole course in one lecture because sociology really is an examination of the interplay between self and Society who am I what am I about how is that empowered or constrained by what we call Society
 will try to Define both and talk about the inner places the whole course in one lesson next week especially next week everybody just stop texting for a second the two lectures next week are the backbone of the course macro and micro Theory we will distinguish the three theoretical perspectives and that will be important to you not just in altering your worldview for the rest of your life but it'll be more than vaguely important on exams you pick which of those two is more important
 so next week is the backbone of the class this sets the tone and next week we're off and running so the macro and micro Theory lectures will be the essence of what we will continue to be about for the rest of the term fair enough
 can I ask you to read chapter 1 of a book written by Charles Wright Mills see Wright Mills
 run at 1959 you probably discovered the language being a little Arcane may be a little hard to read try to translate it into English but I will tell you first but see Wright Mills was an angry old man he was an angry old man was he he was convinced people were stealing his ideas and he stomped around the hallways of Columbia University basically going to give me a reason
 he
 academically his school of thought will fit into what I will tell you next week is sort of conflict theory in his own personal personality personal personality what kind of personality do you have but a personal one
 that we all have
 the ability
 to connect our own stuff
 but everybody else has to go One Step Beyond what you hear a lot will never happen to me smell said you can't globalize your own experience you can situate your own experience in the company of others but you got to talk to them
 he said and this is the definition of the sociological imagination and I'm paraphrasing it I'm translating what he wrote in that chapter into English he said the sociological imagination is what he called equality of the mind and I believe we all have high-quality mines a quality of the mind that helps us use information
 and boy howdy do we have a lot of information to use an information using and retrieval and storage system
 unlike the people that put people on the moon could have possibly imagined
 a quality of mind that helps us use information and develop reason or as I would put it
 think it through think about it
 don't overthink it just think it through and such that
 we can clearly summarize clearly one one or two sentences
 what's happening to us
 and what's happening around us
 the quality of the mind that helps us use information develop reason
 hear stuff think about it and clearly summarize what's happening to us
 and what's happening around us
 let me know straight
 by show hands how many of you would say that if you were tribute if you were writing a resume or a job application to say what are your hobbies and you list them how many feet would have on that list either hunting or fishing either one
 well I want to see strong representation of women that's kind of cool we're typically in the general world do people who get interested in hunting and fishing
 get that interest started where does that happen
 family sure any particular part of the family more than others
 patriarch the guy that tells you the dad jokes right who got their first lesson from Dad over stating the obvious here we go all right
 I'm talking about my dad
 I don't hunt or fish it's not something that he was terribly interested in and I mean it's not like I've never done it I went fishing ice fishing Hudson Wisconsin that was plenty enough
 Etc things baseball more than most of the things so there's no way I didn't do much didn't do much of it
 what's interesting is my dad's personal history he is the third in the birth order of six kids he was born in 1929
 and has to head to older brother's my late Uncle George and my late Uncle Nathan
 my Uncle George and my Uncle Nathan we're lifelong hunters and fishermen my Uncle George is oldest son whose little bit older than me was actually listed as Sportsman of the year in Wisconsin in the Wisconsin Sportsman of the Year magazine this picture on it with a dead deer cool picture
 lifelong hunters and fishermen to my dad's to older brothers their father my grandfather lifelong Hunter and fisherman he retired from his job
 as soon as he could and he had a little trailer set up in northern Wisconsin and he went up and took that trailer and built a house around it
 and basically parked himself on lake noquebay and hunted and fished for the rest of his life okay now there's a cork in the story isn't it my dad 3rd and the birth order following two older brothers and the father that basically lived and breathed hunting and fishing what's up with Dad
 if I was born in 1929 he also it by that by the time the story takes the shape he's got three younger sisters
 so you do the math 1929 he's 12 years old on December 7th 1941 what's that day Pearl Harbor day at which point the US is now fully engaged in the Second World War
 shortly after December 7th 1941 my late Uncle George was serving with the United States Navy on a boat off the coast of Australia watching the South Pacific
 shortly after that my late Uncle Nathan was serving
 in the US Marine Corps also on the South Pacific on the island of Okinawa
 my grandfather is job as I told you was as a crane operator in a metal recycling yard he recycled metal
 why don't I have their fish use your sociological imagination
 they're giving you information think about it for a second why don't I have two fish
 what's that
 cuz my dad didn't but why didn't my dad that's the question
 yeah I mean where who are the people in his life that would logically start jump-starting his interest in hunting and fishing is too older brothers and his dad what are they doing they're off at the war what's grandpa doing working like crazy
 that's right my dad is in a sense the man of the house and the hunters and fishermen are off doing other things so
 probably the mind that helps us use information develop reason such that we can clearly summarize what's happening to us and around us watch this
 I don't hunt or fish today because of World War II
 change my life I wouldn't even born
 and I also did that and iambic pentameter that requires a PhD in sociology pentameter do not like green eggs and ham
 World War II changed the changed everybody's life your life too but in ways that we almost never think about until somebody calls me episode want to go fishing does this involve worms
 how to play baseball
 what's happening to us and what's happening around us
 Mills argues that there are a couple of things in play when we examine our outside societal world's imagine for a second we're going to start a country or culture from scratch when I started up from nothing and the carpet down here looks like it could be in a little square so let's take about six of these squares and figure out what we're going to need to start a country or culture from nothing what's one thing we're going to need
 Bernie people sure where do people come from other people what do we call that
 family family right there
 common belief some sort of moral or ethical framework what's one source for that in our culture
 religion shirt family religion got it what else we going to need
 we're going to take at least six of these so go ahead and throw them out
 food sure we're going to need that in there must be some structure for delivering food and other goods and services what do we call that
 call that the economy government's next government economy go through a hand and then family religion government economy
 sure and where do we learn not just in the family what do we learn the nuances of language how to speak how to conjugate a sentence where does all that come from education family religious education government economy one more social institution more or less controlled by government and economy
 that's all in the news today
 Medicare for all what are we talkin about trying about Healthcare family religion education government economy Healthcare those are the six social institutions we will build a culture on these things and Mills pointed that out
 and said all well and good except you haven't asked the really dirty question who more than others and why or to put it a different way who's got the power
 or to put it as Mills did
 quote what manners of men come to Prevail in this Society of family religion education government politics and health care what matters of men come to Prevail 9 cuz apparently women don't come to prevail
 and have the power in 1959 will get to that
 so it's not just what but who is in charge and how they may be individuals representing us got there
 sometimes he's long pause or just to help me keep my voice in shape
 there are links
 assumptions and characteristics about about individual people that have social meaning
 individual characteristics have social meaning and that can be brought to bear on the extent to which individuals have any power at all and by power I mean the ability to set your own goals and achieving you are exercising enormous Power by finding your way into an American college classroom setting a goal to be credentialed with a degree
 who's got the power and why some of it has to do with access to resources will get to that but some of it has to do with deeply individual and personal characteristics
 so let's start there I have a short list
 before I would say socially consequential
 individual characteristics would you not at would you not agree that if you just sort of Imagine any of those you can conjure up a picture of an individual that might hold one of those titles
 and maybe even imagine a story or two of how that individual lives his or her life
 HIV positive Healthcare component to it is also got a moral and maybe even religious component to it
 ordained minister certainly religious drunk driver
 as it were
 getting on back different from other kinds of military veterans World War II vet
 Desert Storm vet Etc
 get the picture of the cultural and social meaning of individual characteristics I will tell you that one of those four characteristics and only one is true about me I have one of those now some of you may have been few think through the website and you really dig deep you could probably figure this out and if you know you don't get to vote all right cuz we're going to vote now
 which one do you think it is
 I've given you information about myself about things I care about
 you can think about who would say that of these for HIV positive
 is the most likely vote anybody else
 how are you what's your name evaporation
 don't worry about that.
 Do anybody know anybody who might consider switching sections if they found out their profit HIV positive
 if their child's 4th grade teacher was hiv-positive
 considerate social meaning
 it turns out
 that HIV positive
 bring make this thing work is not on the list
 that's in part because HIV shows up in the US roughly a 1980 by that time I've been married for four years the kinds of things that generally put people at risk for being hiv-positive or not readily common in my life cuz I'm a middle-class white guy
 so the odds of my acquiring that except in those days perhaps from a blood transfusion is the result of an accident cuz the blood supply was not terribly well protected but basically ran the block when I was born where I was born to whom I was born and I didn't need a transfusion that's why that's not true
 who would say ordained minister
 who would say drunk driver
 go hits a Vietnam vet
 okay we got that relatively equally mixed of the other three
 I will tell you that I am not
 a Vietnam veteran
 and for this I have a fairly lengthy digression and it's for a very important purpose so buckle up
 I am a vietnam-era civilian with a high draft number the way they did drafting well the way they did it before they win the lottery was basically take people out of low socio-economic backgrounds became apparent to a lot of people that the guys that were dying in Vietnam had no connection to the Congress that wasn't a congressman who usually congressman's kid over there to make it more fair a big drum and it was televised in a big drum with little capsules in it and it was a little piece of paper and every one of those capsules every 366 of them and then they had another drum with 366 capsules in little pieces of paper in them before the random number generators on computers reached into each one and they pulled out of capsule and in one capsule was a day of the year
 February 6th whatever the heck it was the numbers from 1 to 3 6 6 and when they pulled out your birthday and they pulled out a number that was the order in which you got drafted they pulled out my birthday it's in late January they pulled out number 267 and by this time the war is winding down and I figure they're going to get my grandma before they get me I was in college I got to stay there I will tell you that I am plenty old enough to be Vietnam that I am 65 years old
 can I wait a minute that's when you are all supposed to go no way let's try it again I am 65 years old
 thank you thank you very much
 why am I not a Vietnam vet dumb luck to what effect here's the digression and it's important
 my closest friend in high school the guy we packed lunches when we were in fourth grade and had picnics in trees and parks that kind of stuff caught frogs and Creeks as we got older We snuck into hotel swimming pools and raise Havoc later we got ourselves into public pools and to get the attention of the hot looking lifeguard we did everything we could to splasher Rays have I can get thrown out of the pool all that kind of stuff we played Little League Baseball again
 we were going to go out to college together
 until he's born in December I'm born in January that means we were born in different years
 and in the year of his birth they pulled out December 4th and they pulled out number one
 I called him up I said you won the lottery Ron the next word I heard started with an app
 which was the only appropriate response to what I had done he decided he did not want to be drafted and so he enlisted in the US Navy and spent four years to two years tours of West Pacific Duty off the coast of Vietnam destroyer and he was a part of a process that was lobbing
 violence into a country he didn't know about on on people he'd never met and there's a mindset that goes with that that is not easy to acquire that's why training is so rigorous in that process I was very lucky and when he came back to the US he stayed in California who sort of an artist and I think we saw each other probably maybe three or four times more just when I've moved away from our home town would we happen to be in the same place at the same time we get a beer and then I got a phone call from my mom saying that Ron had died
 and I was shocked because he was very old and I still had that happen he said she said how he was shot himself
 kind of like 20 to US military
 today I will do and I didn't know why I still don't know why I know that he was kind of screwed up like all of us were before you went over there and I'm thinking the Vietnam experience even on a destroyer didn't help
 and the only detail I have is that he apparently went to a party got drunk found his way into a bedroom for I don't know what and then you know open the nightstand found a gun into this life just sort of spontaneously and in some way and there's no explaining that
 and who's been to DC and seen the Vietnam Wall
 and you probably left a changed person would you not agree if you remain just when it was designed by an Asian graduate student a woman and when the design was accepted there was this if we had Twitter then it would have exploded with vilification
 and was built anyway to their credit and the veterans validated
 the precisely right mess of that Memorial you just walked past the sort of shadowed and mirrored sequence of names and their in the order of how they were lost and when they were lost
 and I know one another's one name on the wall that was connected to a family one of my folks best friend couples had a son and died at that died there trying to save somebody's life it was a medic and that's the only name that I can attach a face to that's on the wall but I think of Ron every time I tell this story this is the purpose of this digression I think of Ron not so much as a a person whose name is on the wall but I know it's a name that's behind the wall
 in my view and there's that there are 55 or so thousand names on the wall and probably ten times that many
 Pineville
 and it goes back to what I said in the story two or three times that because of random dumbass luck I got to stay in college and I had my dad told me many years later he went to college and you never got out I have a bachelor's degree at two master's degrees in a PhD my former father-in-law said he got more degrees than a thermometer he was drunk he did not mean it as a compliment and that's part of why is my ex-father-in-law anyway
 anyway I got to do that and every time I want to send it teaching now and this story in various this is a longer version of it has been in this lecture at this point forever this is one of the most enduring bits that I do in this class because I made a decision after I knew that Ron was gone that I needed to do what I do
 with precision and care and honor
 because it was just dumb random luck that I'm still here because of Vietnam dumb random luck and I have to honor the fact that that's a blessing so I try to live my life with on and I cannot tell you truthfully that I have never Dishonored
 my profession or my school and I was in college I did that but I've tried to make amends and that's the best we can do that's why I strive for honor is such an important thing here and I forgot to tell you something the other day about my take on academic integrity and I'm just going to throw it in here and you can put it through the filter of draft lotteries and and my friend Ron and the people on in behind the wall there's no small
 amount of fraud there's no measure of little fraud or big products just front I like to tell a story maybe a guy like me going out to an academic conference day is done sitting at a bar
 and probably not a guy like me cuz I was kind of money but notice has a woman that gets his attention or somebody that gets his attention and just because he's been drinking so you know what I will give you $50,000 to go upstairs and spend the night with me
 woman looks and thanks instead of an interesting question I've never done that before but $50,000 so I really enjoyed our company last night dinner was nice the other part was nicer who's twenty bucks
 bingo
 I think it was with you Haley didn't this happen a year or so ago we did a Greg Abbott thing and that involves writing something on a piece of paper and and sign in to get four points for that two of our students but one of our students I guess and I'm done the behest of another one that wasn't there that day took a sheet of paper and a jigsaw puzzle Greg Abbott Pitt was in the same handwriting and turn them in one on top of the other
 like my brother-in-law. Homicide cop says it's easy to catch the dumb ones
 has look tonight ladies and gentlemen if you need to try to cheat us out of four points when grammar school questions can get you half of them back on the next test you may be out of rethink whether you belong in college
 can you maybe ought to rethink what it means to strive for Honor
 and if you find yourself rubbernecking on a test which you can drop if you flunk it you know maybe go to rethink it whether it's worth it cuz we will file if we and I we're not going to catch everybody every time I get it but we will file with the office of student conduct to report and even if you are totally without culpability on that the report gets file to avoid the appearance of impropriety and just you know
 you ain't Cheatin you ain't trying is not the Mantra we want in this class if you're going to strive for honor and that's what I think about sometimes when I think about my friend
 and how I'm I actually got I actually got a date with the Lifeguard and he didn't
 which was great
 white aggression on Vietnam vet thank you for listening to that
 hold on a second I got to get my bearings
 so now we're down to two
 and I will tell you
 drunk driver goes off the list
 technically
 because I cannot truthfully say it happened less than 5 times but more than once I can't know I don't remember how many
 not often but often enough
 for me to stand before you somewhat horrified and embarrassed to say that I have driven behind the wheel of a car when I know I knew I shouldn't
 and when I start examining questions about you know why are you still doing what you get to do because of dumb luck and lots of ways why on those two occasions where that happened a six-year-old never ran out in front of my car that I couldn't avoid hitting if I've been sober at how does your life change when that happens
 dumb luck I'm not a prude I know about inner ear infections I really like ice cold martinis not a lot of them but you know apple a day
 Chucky drink great
 just don't drive
 don't try and if I was a drug treatment counselor for about a year in my life and I did my co-conspirator when we do group therapy was a high school dropout that learned about drug counseling in jail a lot of in a lot of other places he said you know what how do you know you're an alcoholic
 but if you're driving if you're if you get a drunk driving conviction once you never drink and drive again you may drink again that's fine but you just never drink and drive I also think this is worse
 and you should have been there the day when my at the time 9 year old grandson was visiting us from Illinois and I had to call my wife from the car and say we're going to be late I just tapped into the back of another car and there's going to be some who knows what were you doing texting you that I loved you
 you insane yes apparently
 don't be crazy
 that's my little bit on that so now ordained minister is actually true go online if you can do that is actually true that I started this job with a brand new PSP at age 40 and before that I was a full-time Parish minister in the Presbyterian denomination for six or seven years and before that is seminarian and someone here I was a part-time minister of the church in post until about a year-and-a-half ago when I retired and I did something to you the other day like I did the Star-Spangled Banner to you the other day but nothing to you with the intended purpose of reducing the drunk driver vote in this bit today
 I'm introducing ordained minister vote I'm sorry reducing the ordained minister but does anybody have any notion of what that might have might might have been
 oh really that was a then so I couldn't be a priest cuz you know I was married interesting I have not thought that was a slip of the tongue
 I meant we collectively. Country but that's that thought into that you really did you know I was married and that couldn't be at well go to the next priest and you still don't know if you stay ordained or not what else did I do
 I felt like I was a little careless with my use of clean language
 yeah it what the hell a couple times little do you know
 did anybody
 yeah I did I did and I did that on purpose who remembered that may be slightly indelicate use of language that would be inappropriate for an ordained minister did anybody get it few of you guys that was the idea I can't tell you that I never use in delicate language but I try not to
 my wife tells me you know what you are really good with words I got you can make your point without being profane
 I guess
 so I try
 my point in all of this is to say that there are individual things about all of us that carry social meaning and I own it and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have done a lot of things that have given me pause when I think of other thing I mean I've spent a lot of time at hospital bedside
 I have spent a lot of time doing funerals I spend time doing weddings every once in a while a student knows I hate will you marry us not to pull up thanks a lot of already married but I'll stand and watch you get married that's great I think that's every once in awhile at happened I baptize to stillborn Baby One Time
 never forget that so all of these all of our life experiences are personal experiences shape and not just how we view the world and we have to be careful not to globalize that the world sees it the same way the world sees us and there is incumbent upon at least ordained ministers I think to carry themselves in a way that owns up to the fact that you made that choice when I retired from preaching my wife and had a fairly lengthy conversation about what are you going to do with that Creative Energy that you're not putting into sermons and my first thought was I'm going to try stand-up comedy
 I'm not kidding and I thought you know how do you translate that skill-set somewhere else so I went to a couple of Open Mic nights in that time of day and culture just doesn't fit my life very well but I also had to make a conscious decision that if I was going to put together a tenth of 5 or 10 minute comedy set and own who I was cuz being ordered a Minister's really kind of funny actually I would not I would not use what stand-ups use a lot to get lass and that is profanity and skala and it's got a logical imagery and so I did and
 my point is you have to own who you are and you have to live inside your own skin and when you choose to be something and you know other people see you in a way where that starts to matter you have to be responsible who in here is Colonel retired military military anybody just one
 to guide you see yourself differently when you're in the uniform what would that not be true and there are different rules when you're in the uniform that's my point is visible or is easily understood but we all are who we are and have to live inside our own skin in a world
 that gives that social meaning fair enough
 wow we got a long way to go if this thing works like a church bulletins we haven't even picked that we have even sung II him yet
 Christmas stuff for go little quicker
 any questions or comments to this point
 Mills asked us to consider unemployment he makes the distinction between a personal trouble and a social issue
 he says consider unemployment I want to do that the unemployment right now is under 3% it's really really low in males as day it was 10% and he wrote when in a city of a hundred thousand again I'm paraphrasing only one man only one man is unemployed let's just for the sake of argument pretended in this whole class you're the only one without meaningful work okay you're the only one everybody else has a job doing something useful and you're not taking notes it's pretty good view for me to say what is wrong with you what is your major malfunction
 if you're the only one
 what he says what actually Mel said is it's reasonable to question the character of the man I just did that in a weird way
 when in the town of a hundred thousand employment rate is 10%
 we met we do not have a personal trouble which is his problem
 we have a social issue
 we have problems Who Says with the political world in the economic world the structure of opportunity has collapsed he says
 banana plant rates 10%. The 10% of the population are dumps drunk or lazy the structure of opportunity is collapsing for 3 dress we looked at it it's it's not legitimate in that circumstance to wander over here and say what is your problem in yours in yours in yours in yours in yours until we get to 10% and you in the back you are seriously out of line
 we have a structural problem so he makes a distinction between personal troubles and social issues consider unemployment that's his illustration mine is Healthcare
 this is a preview of coming attractions
 where to spend a lot of time in the much later in the term on the health and Medicine lecture talking about the shifting nature of the opportunities in our society lately the discussion on that opportunity structure or structures opportunity
 can be at least hang on the phrase medicare-for-all
 hung on the phrase Obamacare and so on
 we still Affordable Care the impact Affordable Care Act was significant it dropped the uninsured percentage of the population from 17% in 2008 to about 10% to 11% in 2015 on the last three years that has gone up again to about 14% 13 14%
 we still at whatever we buy those numbers we have that still the highest percentage of uninsured people in the planet on the planet of Western developed countries we also spend more
 about as a percentage of GDP we spend more of our money on Healthcare than any other developed country on the planet so we have an opportunity structure that's got to places where it's leaking oil pretty hard it's extraordinarily expensive and a lot of people don't get it
 and what are we going to do about it
 and we can examine politics and economics that's easy take a look at the debate
 in government over the source of providing Healthcare benefits
 take a look at those who are on one side of the other that that get a lot of money from the pharmaceutical and insurance industry
 take a look at the insurance industry whose number one goal is to report profits to stockholders and you have in four sentences the nature of the debate and a fair percentage of why we have the most expensive and most underserved and highest percentage of underserved in the developed world
 consider unemployment consider Health Care
 not quite done with this hold on
 it right about this point in a lecturer probably 15 years ago the young woman wasn't in this room it was room very much liked it so I just thought I'd get over here and somebody else I did and she raised her hand and said rather quietly I went to the doctor a couple weeks ago
 I thought that's none of my business but proceed about 10 years she said I'm 27 years old
 interesting got to the doctor last when she was covered by your parents health care policy
 she said I have stage 4 cervical cancer that was clearly none of my business
 and she said I haven't had the screening test for cervical cancer which is
 they tell me not pleasant but not not uncommon and also extraordinarily effective in catching it in stage 1 and stage 4 means it's there it's in the lymph nodes and it elsewhere in your body
 but for a
 $40 copay and maybe $1,000 medical procedure which you will pay 10% of if you're insured
 catching it at stage one makes it stage 4 she basically had stage 4 cancer cuz you don't have enough money
 to get it caught and I don't know what happened to that woman it's been 15 years
 but I think of her when I think of how do I put a face on what this means
 when it becomes a political football and all people do is yell at each other socialist fascist cruel stupid
 is it worth I put up I'm going to put a face on that kind of like my pal Ron to give you something to at least start your thinking in a different direction but for a couple hundred bucks I suspect a woman who was back in college at age 27 which implies some stories to
 probably had about a 25% chance of living 5 more years and I have no idea what happened after that
 I hope she's one of the 25% I hope she's still alive
 but the reason in that instance but you cannot globalize but you can imagine
 I was short a few bucks I cut a corner I decided to pay rent instead of go to the doctor as it work
 consider Health Care
 what's in it for you
 what if you jump start and develop the sociological imagination what what's in it for you
 well there are three things one
 you have the opportunity
 to have commonly held assumptions challenged
 the Sociological Imagination challenges commonly held assumptions now that little 10-question quiz I gave to all of us the other day but those were commonly held assumption
 and I told you that I would talk about the nuances of the welfare one today
 search for people on welfare could work if properly motivated it turns out that a substantial proportion of people on welfare we know about 50% 1 into our children
 and we can't get them work permits and pick their little keisters out of our house and send them to work cuz the labor department won't let us they can't all go overseas and work for Nike okay nevermind
 or Apple
 half our children
 half for elderly or disabled
 so now we're down to you know and and legitimately so I mean we have checks and balances on this we track who gets various forms of Public Assistance and I'm sorry about all forms of Public Assistance
 and that other 25% that are not children elderly or disabled we have several categories I'm not going to try to flush all this out you can look up these numbers and they change a little bit over time but not that much
 in that last 25%
 we have people that in Factor working you can do the arithmetic on how far a minimum wage job will get you when you have to pay rent car payment gas childcare
 minimum wage job will generate what about 13 $1,400 a month to minimum wage jobs let's generously say 3000 two kids in daycare half of that gone
 rather house payment you're down to about six or seven hundred dollars to do everything else in your life
 can I give a month
 and if your heater goes out
 I replace my air conditioning and heater about 8 years ago the bill is $10,000 I was very lucky to have been able to absorb that
 over half the u.s. population would have difficulty absorbing a $500 emergency that's how close a lot of people are almost half that's how close they are
 tell our people are working a lot of people are looking for work and we have to end and if you are looking for work and collecting unemployment benefits we have servers that will track how hard you're looking for work and if you don't look for work hard enough they will stop the payment
 they are working there looking for work at home caring for children I just told you what the cost of childcare is it's actually cheaper, more cost-effective to innocence pay yourself by not working to take care of your own and don't we also believe that that's a family value
 so we got kids elderly disabled people that are working looking for work caring for children
 and a lot of them are in college or trying to be junior college typically
 one of the most interesting little life lessons I got was when I was working on a master's degree in since I already had another one they let me teach and I taught night school at a tiny little Junior College in the middle of nowhere elanoy tell Tanya Tucker sociology and I had about 22 students in class in about six of them
 we're in class and receiving state benefits to go back to school and have benefits for their children they're on welfare six of them about a third of the class
 and there's a small room everybody sort of knew each other and at the end of class there would be this little line of six people coming up to the podium right here and I would have to sign off on that bad a state printed attendance sheet and I had to sign off on that saying they were there in this one day they got. Two days I got kicked off
 so for that reason alone but for other reasons and they were typically you know night school is were typically people in their in their 20s some in their 30s
 they were putting their lives back together from having some form of of turmoil and they were doing so with public assistance they were doing so under surveillance
 and they were my best students laugh are a little bit I can't think of a better place for someone getting my tax money for welfare then to be in school why cuz I'm a sociologist and what I know about three things for sure sociology and one of them is this that there is an absolute between education and crime doesn't matter how you measure it doesn't matter where you measure in the u.s. higher the education to lower the crime end of store so you can pay me now or pay me later
 spend a few welfare bucks to help folks get their feet back underneath them in junior college or someplace like that or
 spend ten times that put them in jail
 your call
 when you factor all that out of people on welfare could work if properly motivated and you factor out Children elderly disabled those that are working looking for work caring for children college-bound about 1 or 2% and it's actually it's actually actually cost more for us to try to catch him then it does what they're cheating the system for now that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to catch him it's wrong it's dishonorable you shouldn't cheat the system
 they have to ask yourself well I learned it worked and without reasonable opportune without reasonable Alternatives maybe you know maybe it's still worth it
 and you will hear people say
 and it just hurts my ears to say it as I've heard it so many times and in my Ministry talking to parishioners I just hate it when them women just keep popping them babies out to get that welfare money
 what planet you do you know how much money they get for one baby and that's not a lot child
 girls Labor Statistics suggest that when you take your child home from the hospital from the time you do that till the time you send them out of the house at 18 whether they're going to college or not you have dumped a quarter million dollars into their life at least
 and some people think it's cost-effective because another 200 a month
 do the arithmetic it's insane and yet for some it's the only rational Choice what else
 so they struggle along and then everywhere they go they get stigmatized and yelled at and these days macht on Twitter constantly
 that's what's behind that commonly held assumption
 fair enough
 oh and one more thing how you going to help doc you're so smart watch this I'll fix you you look like a Welfare Queen to me
 it really do I can spot them a mile away
 lucky for you it's payday
 is your welfare on the government
 we're not done
 you will not buy beer with this money swear okay
 no marriage Awana neither I don't care if it's legal I really don't I don't want you making tcbol with this who just went South Park good at least two people I can do cartoon voices
 no marijuana okay no beer in a marijuana or like products one more
 no Haagen-Dazs for you chaps my backside harder than being in the line at Walmart getting my groceries buying that generic waxy crap ice cream somebody with a damn Lone Star Card buying Haagen-Dazs I hate that
 who bet that would that would hurt the net
 you know you heard it
 alright lucky you are you go
 was that fun can I my money back please you don't even want to pick it up
 here's the point of thank you cuz I'm the taxman
 throwing money at poor people does not help
 it just humiliates them and makes them mad
 how much control how much power do you have if I choose when you get it how much you get and what you can spend it on none you know what
 a school system and a Health Care system that works
 end of story
 challenges commonly held assumptions
 it also gives us a shot at understanding where we have a leg up and where we are where we are where we are his words where we are in power to constrain
 what elevates are odds
 I think that any human being sitting in a US College classroom has hit Lottery odds with regard to worldwide life chances where we have where we have 50 people or less that have the same net worth as half the world's population the bottom half 50 people vs 3.5 billion have the same net worth that level of despair of which side of that equation do you want to be born.
 only when sitting in the u.s. college classroom is tilted vastly toward those 50 people not there but vastly toward it
 who would you say is probably the most well-known
 graduate of Yale University Yale one of the one of the Ivy League schools are the best schools in the country class of 1968 class roster anybody got a guess
 woman graduate Yale 68
 2 years ago everybody knew her name
 compulsory
 Don't Play It Again Sport I don't think graduated from you from college at Yale in that year
 who is running for president 2 years ago yeah everybody would say that's true and she did in fact graduate from college in 1968 we have supper valedictorian speech it's really quite remarkable
 but Shane graduate from Yale graduate from Wellesley ever heard of Wellesley College
 it's one of the Seven Sisters in other words the ivy league for girls did you know we had that we still do but colleges are still in existence Wellesley Smith Barnard Vassar Mount Holyoke to others I can't remember what they are Smith I think
 they made their first woman I believe it was either in 68 or 69
 check your chromosomes at the door
 opportunities constraints based on what
 you did a heck of a terrible job of picking your chromosomes when you got born if you wanted to go to Yale University that's all I got to say
 freedom huh
 opportunity structures
 imagine you know people more like you than not an imagine some of the people
 you imagine the most different from you
 trying to get the same thing and how many and what percentage are denied the opportunity for that for reasons that over which they have no control
 I was working as a drug counselor we were talking about the disease concept of addiction you know people basically I mean from this point of view basically in here at their addiction and you know the absurdity of blaming people who have inherited a proclivity for a problem whether it's a diction or Ms or diabetes or whatever it is
 if you blame them for it you're essentially saying you should have done a better job of picking your parents
 right
 you don't pick your parents poorly you can do land to somebody somewhere
 and the vast majority of American college students landed in a pretty good spot. Globalizing that in it and I I know what were the years thousands of stories of places where they land
 and then are doing well as a result so it's not an either-or thing all I'm saying is let's give it some perspective sociological imagination Challenge, and get a fairly good grip on the opportunities and constraints with which were presented and the punchline to this segment is this
 if you want to know with at least better than 50-50 probability
 the life chances for Upward mobility and material comfort of anyone in the US and you can only ask one thing
 here's the question you asked you ready
 who's your daddy
 it's that simple
 finally
 sociological imagination enables us to push back it was just to push back it's not like we're always being done unto
 we can push back and giving you a couple links on this can we change the world individually change the world to know that the world changes individuals can we change the world but I don't know
 you can use information and think about it
 here's some information
 about which you can think there's a link here on this on the side yourself in two sides right under the Mills chapter forced labor in the things we buy
 US Department of Labor put this out in 19 in 2015
 it measures what gets made where and by whom
 list of products produced by Forester indentured child labor by country it just goes on I mean just keep reading it and then the question to ask yourself is
 do I want to advance the world that is being created by that by buying those products or engaging those Services the other way you can do it list and see who or what company is being boycotted by
 sunroof for that reason yes ma'am
 sure first it enables us to challenge commonly held assumptions second it enables us to examine our own opportunities and constraints
 third we can push back and change the world for the better
 incrementally and not by much but hey
 we can examine who makes what that we buy
 and examine the process by which It's Made
 why do discussion these days over trade with China we get a lot of consumer products from China That's why tariffs on those consumer products are having such consequence etc etc etc by home
 I tell you the work ethic is Chinese children really bugs me when I get something to eat then work
 what did you just say
 I got real ticked off at that
 you can't not buy things that were made in ways and by people who chose to make them in that way because it was cost-effective whether or not it was abusive you can avoid that
 but you can at least examine your response one of the key features of 12-step living whether you used 12-step living to not drink or drug or not it's not a half bad way to live for lots of other reasons one of which one of the 12 steps is we have made a list of the people we have hurt or the wrongs we have done which is not a terrible thing to do on a daily basis or at least you know that's why Catholics go to confession it's helpful
 and make amends when possible make a man's make a mint this is a stupid example and I only share it with you not to give you the idea that I'm such a great person I want to give you the idea that this is a way to Think Through information and act on it such that usually what a tiny bit better than you found it if you read my bio my little bio page it's got about two paragraphs I'm a fitness Runner and all three or four years ago I developed a case of plantar fasciitis from Fitness running which is really lousy you can't walk like this so it's really hard to run and it does not go away
 but it went away after about a year and so I went on Google and tried I need a new pair of running shoes I wore what running shoes are best for plantar fasciitis running shoes that are especially good for that and I like Nike has a terribly checkered past with regard to its labor practices they're getting better but if they have a horrible history
 so I thought I'd want to spend a hundred bucks on Nike shoes but you know I just want to keep running so I bought Nike shoes and I'm 65 years old so I have probably more discretionary income the most college cancel whatever I decided a conscious decision that if I was going to buy Nike shoes and do an incremental a small tiny bit of violence to my world
 I was going to try to do an equally incremental a small tiny bit of good and so I gave $100 to the South Plains Food Bank
 it's just that way of thinking I mean that the hundred bucks didn't mean very much to the food bank in the hundred bucks I spent didn't gain Nike very much or stop them from doing terrible things but it created a mindset that I think can catch on
 if you decide consciously
 to seek ways to make amends when you hurt someone or your world
 or if U seek even more profoundly to take one breath
 before you intentionally hurt someone because the ripple effect on that I think it was called the butterfly effect that the flapping of wings of a butterfly in the Himalayas causes a hurricane and I mean that's it look up the butterfly effect I said it but that's what it is you can create your own choosing to be aware
 of what might be out there in the consumer product world
 by choosing
 are choosing maybe to who in the last year has written a scathing email to or about somebody or something or something they are so going to get it
 right
 before you hit send
 ask yourself just this
 maybe there's something going on in that person's life I don't know anything about
 and then
 clear it for the sake of the world
 for the sake of putting a little bit of butterfly effect and make the world a little bit better
 that's the course in one lecture questions
 thanks everybody really appreciate it
