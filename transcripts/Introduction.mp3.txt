pleased to meet you
 hope you guess my name
 first thing I want to tell you is the absolute truth I'm the only Professor on the Texas Tech campus it does not know how to spell his own name
 I do not
 spell Koch we pretend that it's spelled c o okay in my family which is the translation of the German word spelled k o c h for one who prepares food I'm dr. cook Jerry Cook nice to meet you
 it turns out that if you correctly pronounce my name in the German language it is the correct pronunciation
 and somehow try to give you the Heimlich maneuver
 and there's a sociology lesson in the thirties when members of my family with that name decided they were going to anglicize it although they just forgot to stop by the county clerk's office in change the spelling
 who is the German name in the 30s not exactly the one you want to walk around with if you want to be a good American kind of like being part of the bin Laden family today you know
 so I get it but it's it's been a source of interesting social psychology my whole life when they call out your name you know on the listing to they're going to get to the cage and you know it was easy to pronounce who hates roll-call exactly
 well if you signed up for an adductor e sociology or the right place and as I say on Jerry Cook and I will give you now the definition of what we're about the definition of what we're about this is sociology
 that was sign language
 sociology is
 the scientific study
 the scientific study
 of human social
 groups the scientific study
 of human social groups
 hey dude
 actually this is this looks like cursive
 that's a lost iron I am deeply impressed I just went on eBay and bought my 11 year old granddaughter a vintage cursive writing book just because like she needs it
 that's where the wastebasket should be
 I mean I didn't steer you wrong that's what it is it's just not the most important of what it is I'm going to tell you what sociology is now and I went to pencils down
 do not write this
 absorb it into your being
 sociology is not just the scientific study of human social groups
 Neil
 I'll get to you later
 where was I I was about to give you the essence of the course right
 it is the art
 Hub interpreting our social World The Art of interpreting our social World in context in context. Just what we do or when we do it it's where this is occurring the art of understanding context and you all failed art class about 5 minutes ago
 who is ever heard in your entire life the music that closed off that video montage of about 5 minutes and there was a sequence of slides that went over the over the music that had this oddly shaped red white and blue symbol sequentially right who's ever seen that symbol before
 how many you have never in your entire life on or about the first day of class either heard that song or the Pledge of Allegiance and seen that symbol occur in a classroom before ever
 what's your next move
 right
 there was one person standing in the back but I think she got in light
 nobody else this is my theory that at least a lot of you are going
 what's my next move
 if you hear that song and see that symbol on Saturday the football game will be preceded by
 Honor America please rise gentleman remove your caps and join with the Goin band from raiderland
 right awaiting instructions
 Uncle Frank or somebody like in buzzcut kind of guy in your life let's be frank and if you reported to him that for the end of this whole film thing they played the national anthem and I sat on my ass
 probably use Uncle Frank's next move something like
 okay I'm overstating it right
 why were you confused all kinds of curveball because Toto we're not in Kansas anymore right big university
 what's at the Prime 3 months ago for god sakes right figure this out
 that Montage was designed to throw into the room but I think are very useful
 ways of be a phase that you will be about you will be about initially failure
 you'll be about challenge by the way home through the baseball movie is Bull Durham which is inarguably in my opinion the best not just baseball bats sports movie ever and by the way if it appears on the exam the correct answer the question what is the best sport is baseball that the correct answer
 failure
 challenge I didn't know until I put this Montage together several years ago that that movie Officer and a Gentleman and I knew the scene but I didn't know that Cadet Della Sera was the math major at Texas Tech I thought that was kind of cool
 so there's that third movie was Apollo 13 which is an excruciating Lee dramatic example of what they had to do to get those guys back safely never the story of the Three Guys in the lunar module trying to get back trying to live until I get back and they're running out of oxygen CO2 filter doesn't work using nothing but that cuz that's all I got
 that's engineering that's improvising useful skill failure challenge
 I am the videographer that little piece we were uncommonly lucky 3 years ago when we went to our Alabama beach vacation spot and just saw a sea turtle nest explode if you went to visit unbelievably cool and this little guy
 otter
 who is Pat Benatar
 dim the time in yet okay the last words strive for Honor I'll get to that
 what are we about in college that's different from education Pryor we are about inquiry and a derivation of that word is inquisitive
 what about asking questions more than worry about answering questions
 the absolute worst question you can ask a Texas Tech faculty member or ta
 is what's going to be on the test
 let me introduce Haley Larkin second-year Master student in our department she is my thesis advisor and she's a full-time ta for this class in the one at 9:30 Muhammad Ilyas first-year ta and I is the halftime ta44 this class
 they will answer your questions
 I will answer your questions we will have office hours we will have driving time you can make an appointment
 but the worst question you can ask is what's going to be on the test you know why
 if you ask me what's going to be on the test and I tell you and I'll tell you the truth and you
 I own your ass I do I own you
 the best question you can ask is
 really
 I thought of it that way before
 and twice in the course of this term you want her out of class going
 I need to figure out if I need to look that up
 and I tell you what I'm going to ask the next time I'm there what I said if that happens twice that's a good thing but I had students alter my program by asking me a question and catching me up short on something and I investigate and put it in the curriculum there be three or four places in the course of this of our work here when in the middle of a lecture on their say I owe a student for what I'm about to say
 and
 are you going to do is do one of these
 I mean don't just yell out cuz we're playing and I'll do one of two things I'll either do this thing out going to finish the sentence and I'll get to you or I'll just call it and then we will just go where we go
 here's why it's important to ask questions why is more important to ask questions and answer them
 one of the benefits of being a student at a research University is that people like me get paid to ask questions and we get evaluated by the extent to which we publish the questions we ask the answers we come up with and then and then and then most importantly the questions that the research raises not the questions it answers have been apart a research team for 20 years or so that has collectively published 35 or so articles on tattoos and piercings somebody has to do it 5 years ago
 we put a piece out that I don't want to say it went Fireball but it went I would say subclinical a bacterial
 Yahoo help pick it up and then we were waiting I was our 15 minutes or so of Fame we work when you can look it up it's all over the Internet it's on tattoos
 and what we learn we did what we did is we surveyed students just like you sitting in class is just like this one we spent three years traipsing all over the country to 12 different universities and how about 3,500 respond and we learn that among those 3500
 the women in the group that had for tattoos or more
 the women with four more tattoos we're different from every other subcategory in the study in two ways one they have higher self-esteem
 2 they were about twice as likely to report to us but they had at least once attempted suicide higher self-esteem
 high-level comparatively a suicide attempt
 right
 so we thought okay we didn't expect that when we know and what we think what should we ask next well we know
 that women especially whose lives have been disrupted and violated by cancer and who have lost a part of their physical selves in the process of breast cancer particularly that sometimes they will replace that part they will reclaim ownership of that part
 through very elaborate and beautiful tattoos just Google breast cancer tattoo and you will see some stunning thought emotion meaning and drama
 we talked and we know that maybe your breast cancer survivors do that baby and we cleaned the phrase suicide survivors we're doing the same thing we don't know
 there's a master's thesis topic hanging right in the middle of the room you want to go investigate that go find out
 the question we asked what's up with this was more important than the answer we found and that is the Hallmark of all good research and one of the benefits of spending time with us as faculty to research University is that you get to hear about this morning
 how to tell you something that only four people are so in the world now right now I know it my co-author knows it and our wives
 now you're going to know in a minute that people who has religious tattoos at least in our little studying who's tattoo is overtly religious
 are very much like really religious people without tattoos
 feathers are really religious
 we also know that people with just any tattoos angular tattoos if you will are somewhat more likely to drink and drug and have multiple sex partners
 what we have learned when we sort of combine those insights is it people with religious tattoos are more like the people with tattoos on sex drugs and drink then they are like a religious people
 they're more like the religious people on religion did you get that
 so we're developing an overarching theory of sensation-seeking
 we think that
 drinking marijuana use and sex are sensory experiences and that's what unites them
 prohibition
 for those with religious tattoos so you're the you're the people in addition to the four that knew that before I walked into this room
 does it matter I don't know
 we're presenting at a meeting in St Louis in October I'll show you the power points at some point during the class and that that's the benefit of hanging out with us we ask questions and we tell you what we found the most importantly we ask more questions so that's your job
 what's up with that
 the hell that's the most important question least important question is what do you want us to know I want you to know
 what benefits you
 I want you to know what you want to learn that may or may not be what's in this class but hey you get social Behavioral Science and call now will double the offer you get multi-cultural so at least you got that going for you
 let me walk you through this is the link I sent all of you that we're registering the class on Friday if you registered since then you didn't get that email
 there's a little bit about us about our department about the university I gave you the course evaluation comments from last semester even the main ones maybe read this thing
 in bother you should see what other people have said this is our research page little bit of information and so on and I spell it right this page will come up first and then you can look at Introduction to Sociology this is where all of our work starts how many of you have found this page if you can't find it try Googling my name and going and clicking this link or just send me an email or we'll get it to you
 I will tell you that there's an audio recording device going on right now and every lecture in addition to a few other things will be posted on this page. All of the lectures will be audio recorded and you can go back and use them as a study guide actually go back and figure out you know what did I miss what did he say I'll find out it's a PDF file you can print it out but this is the page I want to go to for the moment this is where everything starts a couple little bit of background material things here hoping a reading I'll get to the window here in a second but part one has one two three four topics of the first of us topics will be in play on Thursday this week and you should read these two readings and connect on these two links prior to class and that will help you understand election so all of the readings are right there they're free and others
 text book to buy
 at the start of each section look at part 2 there two links which sociological perspective in the macro micro triangle I have sometimes like to talk about this as this is the whole course on one page this is a whole course on one page I called the macro-micro triangle it doesn't make any difference if you don't I mean you won't know much about this at all but you will by the end of next week so that's the triangle there's another link called which sociological perspective and that's simply a narration of the triangle these are words that say the same thing as this picture
 I dropped the feedback on the mic sorry
 I better go get better can you hear me in the back still
 which sociological perspective the macro micro triangle I'm going to tell you what's going to be on the test so you don't have to ask
 there will be lots of questions 50 each on all the tests but they will be lots of questions that begin with these three words which sociological perspective and in the course of our work this term I will teach you about three sociological perspective not the only one and your job is going to be to be able to distinguish it what they are about in and of themselves and then to apply what you know to a question like which sociological perspective would claim that Medicare for all reduces social inequality or something like that has infected is in fact a test question on the first test so there you go
 why do I do that I think it is vital that you know that there's more than one way to look at things there are points of view of points of departure there are nuances and how you see and there are strengths and limits to every point of view
 why is this important has nothing to do with sociology my sister is a family nurse practitioner she's she's a primary care provider she takes care of people in emergency room she's worked for 35 years in an ER as a family nurse practitioner she saves lives I'm a sociologist vapor locks what am I going to do for my group
 useless where the screen door on the academic submarino we're not we contribute the study of diversity
 the most important thing she ever learned as a primary caregiver in an emergency room she saves lives every week I mean literally
 there's more than one way to be right
 did more than one way to be right
 and if anybody anywhere tells you I'm the only one with the answer
 listen to somebody else
 which sociological perspective that's really the the heart of not just what I want to teach you about how I want to teach you how to think how I want to teach you how to think there's more than one way to be right
 every point of view has strengths and limits and which way of looking at the world makes the most sense to you so that's the heart of the class what you should do in preparation for Thursday see this little thing that says study guide of lecture outlines and handouts were part 1
 there's one that says study guide of lecture handouts and outlines and handouts for part 2 and part 3 4 5 and 6 it's a PDF file download
 print it out lots of students find it helpful to get a loose leaf three punch thing and these become your study guys
 the this is the lecture outline for self and Society who more than others and why and this is like the the sequence of songs that a stage play this is the order of events and I'm going to give you Insight soundbite points of information on everything and so you going to write your own study guide and when it comes time for an exam take these study guides to the review session which will happen every day prior to the exam it was going to run those
 and asked to fill in the gaps what time is or just go to the audio what I miss you would have sent you in a sense write your own study guide I will also entertain questions about things you were are on Sheriff right before we pass out the test
 so you write your own study guide
 these readings that are on point for each day you should call them up read them you don't have to understand them completely I will tell you quite candidly that the macro series topic which is a week from today the durkheim piece on suicide and marks on the Communist Manifesto they are written in English words but I will translate them into English
 that's my job
 prosthetic religious tattoo hey that sounds interesting that I don't have to translate into English I wrote it
 can you get it for free anyway you should take a look at those if not fully understand them test questions will come from both lecture and reading I will say things and lectures are covered in the readings RB things in the readings that I won't talk about and if at the end of your reading any of the stuff whether it's an article or a lake or a newspaper piece if you could tell your mom in two or three sentences what it was about you got it
 the essence of that not not dates details and stuff like that I want you to get the the Insight that you can use to ask more questions out of all this stuff there's some stuff out there it's provocative by Design if I mean there may be things that I say or that you read that will cause you to go that just pisses me off and I'm going to go look it up it should very things that are worth being cranked about that we talked about you
 so that's how you handle the readings that's how they're connected to the exams
 and everything just goes as it does I mean it's pretty much a one-trick pony I hope you like the trick so
 any questions about that stuff so far but where to get the information
 cuz I'm going to go over the syllabus next
 handouts and readings this is the exam review schedule all of the exams are already in place they
 decorative masks on building minutes come to 81 or where that is and they will occur the day prior to each exam at 4 in the afternoon
 I'll tell the outside with the Mist exam policy in a syllabus this course satisfies Core Curriculum requirement syllabus is stuff I have to tell you and that I've just crib from what the university tells me I have to tell you
 except for this
 sociology is the study of social diversity
 and hopefully we learn how to think not what to think we contribute to the academy the scientific study of the causes and consequences of diversity
 how are we different today in our diverse cultural makeup and what does it mean to be minority or not today then two years ago
 10 years ago
 50 years ago
 I grew up in Wisconsin and spent most of my life in the Midwest and I came here 25 years ago and after I was here about a week it occurred to me because I was a PhD drain sociologist no because I'm a human being
 did anybody who grew up in this part of the country or any place south of the Mason-Dixon line that was not white
 grew up on a different planet than I did being a white guy from the Midwest and we'll talk more about that as the time goes on
 let's get to the details
 all this stuff for outcomes and expectations who wants to know how you're going to be evaluated how do I get a grade in this class who cares you should be here
 most of the evaluation comes from your work on 6 exams
 there will be six 50-point multiple choice true-false questions throughout the course of the of the term 5 exams and a final exam
 they're all the same they're all 50 question exams and the final exam is the final only in the sense that it's the last one it's just be covers most of the material to fight at the back end of the course of those six exams only your five highest count everyone's lowest exam is dropped what does that mean means if you if you just wake up sick on the day of an exam don't take it it's just the one we drop no problem
 if
 you miss an exam because you got what we might call euphemistically an inner ear infection that's the polite name for a hangover
 feel the same
 and you miss a test fine no problem that's whatever reason if there is drama or trauma in your life in your health or at home and you miss an exam go miss it no problem if you take 5 exams and you aced them all and you've been here for the little attendance pieces I'll get to in a minute
 no need to take the final you can drive you can get it you can take a zero on the final if you're happy with what what else you got and you are in the gray and pink eye so that make sense
 here's where students sometimes get tripped up and here is where my approach to things is somewhat at its it's a little different than others there are no makeup exams we don't have makeups but what if you're sick drop it drop the test you know no problem but it means I'll have to take the final the final you know they're all the same. That's the missed exam policy that you should read very carefully but let me explain it it's been my experience that if you tell 278 students exactly when the tests will be and they pay attention and put them on their calendars they won't miss one because they forgot they might miss one cuz they're sick
 and I might miss one cuz there's family drama and you should for sickness or family from now is that sickness or family drama spills into a second test
 take an incomplete go fix the sickness and family drama the stuff you can pick this up anytime it affect you can makeup at a store to next semester or year from now so that's how I handle it with the dean of students office we sign a very simple form an agreement if if your life
 causes you to miss to tasks for other than inner ear infections thank you
 fix your life will pick this stuff up later I really believe that's what's important fair enough I also believe is happening and especially your health is none of my business so don't send
 notes from the sick place or whatever it is you call that's not my business if you're if you need to deal with the doctor go deal with it and that's just it you know and I will help you in any way we can that's why I post audio lectures I post audio files every lectures audio recorded if you miss a lecture just listen to it no problem and I can be a good good thing for test review
 now attendance actually I don't have an attendance policy I have a social Behavioral Science Greg Abbott Governor the state of Texas required communication policy
 because it's a task because it's a Core Curriculum course we are required by the state to assess and Report the results of the assessments of your ability to communicate my way of doing that is on 5 days at pretty much random days in the term some of my scripted but mostly I just walk in and say guess what it's Greg out of day today and then write this or do that and when is Greg Abbott day and there will be five of them
 if you do what ever it is we do usually it's write a paragraph of something good relation to lecture you get 4 points and there are five of those times for his 20 points so 20 points of your Grey come from Greg Abbott communication day and 250 points come from exams 270 points are possible in this class
 10% of 90% of that is 243 so 243-2270 is an a consider it a really considered a bowling game
 every test question you get ride that knocks down a pain every time you're here for Greg Abbott day that's for Pins like you get the puke like you get the back row right
 and what does that mean it means you have five days of the class I believe there are 22 lectures in the course I 2021-22 something like that
 that means that five of them if you miss one will cost you four points it means a 17
 now you just don't know which ones they are right so that's a that's a wrinkle
 so you can try the game and I suppose but here's why I have an attendance component at all
 it's I think a way of enabling you to tell yourself am I getting what's the most important thing I can get out of college I'll tell you what that is in a second
 in Practical terms if you miss anyone day of class there's about a 20% or so chance it'll cost you four points
 not a lot I will also tell you this is a digression I will also tell you that I never exam I said they were 50 questions and every damn I lied
 I'll try to tell you when I lie sometimes I lie and not tell you what's the time I'll tell you the truth there 52 questions and every test their two questions as the very end test your ability to remember what you learned in Grammar School
 and if you get you can actually get 52 out of 50
 is there a perfect score is 50 but you can get 52 so you can pick up 10 of those 20 points you might miss by missing every single day at class
 five calling back with you learn the grammar school that's my way of compensating for that
 if we gave makeup exams and if we offered makeup opportunities for people that Miss Greg Abbott a the teenage would do nothing but that will 556 of you into classes it's just it is so, but here's the larger point
 your attendance score your Greg Abbott score on a 20lb a sign on to you of how Adept you are becoming
 at holding up your end of the deal you agreed to in advance
 can you say that again how good are you at holding up your end of a deal to which you have already agreed that's the most important life skill you can pull out of 4 years of college I am I live in a small condo that is was built 40 years ago and over the years we've got a lot of contractors come in and do stuff I am stunned how hard it is to find a contractor who will come in and say I will do this and that for this much money by that day and then do it
 you want to be that contractor in all aspects of your life I will do this by then for this much money and then do it that's what the syllabus is I will be here from 11 to 12:20 on Tuesday and Thursday for this. Of time absent something extraordinary
 that's when the exams will be writing down might want to plan your inner ear infections around that
 fine and dandy it is possible that something extraordinary will change that 2 years ago my father died around Thanksgiving we had to switch the exam it was around if that happens or something like that happens you will get a benefit for that we gave makeups for that test for people that had to miss so that's how it works but it will require something like that to change that syllabus that is a contract no makeups and I don't neither need nor want a recitation of your health history none of my business if you miss cuz you're sick be sick go get better
 fair enough one of the things you might not agree that all these are great rules
 you might think that's the dumbest thing I ever heard I have had students
 there was an email exchange that went about 12 back and forth over why don't I get my for Greg Abbott points because I was sick and I'm going to miss out on an a because of that know you're going to miss out on a date because you missed three other Greg habit days for inner ear infection but be that as it may
 you may not think this Earth that these are reasonable or Fair rules that's okay have a different point of view to you signed a contract in those are the rules of the game
 in one sense it's a lesson in adulting I've been doing this here for 25 years in about 5 years prior elsewhere I still believe that if there's a fair chance they will act like adults
 and I'm going to try to treat you like adults I tell you what's going to be on the test if I lock the door so you're so you're so you're so they can do so that you don't come in late
 that's treating you like children and I think it's going to come in late you come in late. No problem what did I miss go listen to the tape easy right does it distract me not especially
 on the other hand
 who's who's computer when I was at a phone or what was that it was on your phone is synced to your laptop and sighted
 I mean I have colleagues and if that happens the next words are class dismissed nobody gets credit for today
 I think that's treating our children
 adult to adult I'm just going to tell you that that's distracting and when I get distracted get causes me stress and I have to sort of you know that's not the only thing that distracts me by the way I got a little adult ADHD brother figured that out
 when I'm distracted I have to backtrack and him I was just just it's unpleasant and it's you know it's stressful for me cuz I'm trying to give you my best act adult-to-adult just turn them off
 just turn them off and I know why don't you do that because if it's in your pocket like this and it goes
 it's like needing crack I can't not check this out who's gotten a text so far since 11 who's answered it
 I'll come on Whose Line
 okay I didn't see it but it is distracting and it will cause a glitch in what I'm trying to do to whatever now if it's you and I can see you right there but I might do is while you're texting I'll just go stand right here and I'll keep lecturing for a little while
 so that might happen
 but I have given up trying to be a fascist about this and just asked you if asked for your help and there's the other thing if you actually turn them off while you're in class and it's like Christmas
 so that's the benefit I'm just going to I'm just going to ask for your Indulgence on that fair enough
 where was I'm sorry about the aggressions wasn't if you read the course evaluation comments you might have heard interesting guy kind of funny now and then goes off on tangents yes I do
 add one student's a doctor cooked Mine Train makes all the stops
 here's what I'm trying to do when I do that and sometimes the digressions are scripted in my mind or on my outline I know when I'm going to go off on a tangent here and the reason I go off on a tangent is to give you something that I thought about based on what I just said in other words I'm taking what I am taking the lecture stuff to another level and trying to give you a different point of view and I've actually Illustrated that on the hotline on the handouts page on what I call out the window okay I'm going to tell you a little bit about this
 two visual slide piece that I've got here
 if it'll ever pop up okay I got to shrink this I just learned the Control - shrinks things that's pretty cool in it about a hundred yards due east of my front door I live in a condo complex that has one of these this is a cut this is a Playa Lake in town that's on 55th and Salem and this is looking straight to the south on a beautiful little scene on a spring afternoon I don't know if there's any Wildlife out there that you can see or not but that's the view out my front window which I really like
 5 seconds before I took this picture I took a picture a hundred and eighty degrees look in the other direction straight down Salem Avenue toward 50th Street and this was that picture
 that's a hobu it's a dust storm if you haven't had experience in Lubbock if you're lucky will that thing is barreling down 50th Street at about 40 miles an hour and in about 20 seconds that picture was Brown
 that's what I digress in Izzo by the way have a look at this it'll take me 45 minutes to talk about it
 I'm going to give you another look out the window that's the point okay
 all right
 let me ask at this point are there any lingering questions about the contract the syllabus do you understand it whether or not you like it or agree with it
 any questions about anything
 drive to things we're going to get do probably take most of the rest of time
 it sucks we are like we're out of my Calculus class in 10 minutes hate this
 really hard questions
 okay how many of you overachievers went to the handouts page and discovered that your professor really is a lion sac
 pop quiz for the first date who found that
 and so you're thinking when I'm saying there's only 50 point exam get what about that pop quiz in class exercise and there are no points available for it we're just going to go through it one by one
 these are true-false questions and I just want to buy a show of hands get a read on the room for each of these 10 things okay
 stop timeout I forgot one thing every once in awhile as happened I was just looking over there and I don't know why it occurred because I forgot it in the first class
 I want to go back to the syllabus for a second will get to this here in a moment I want to go back to the syllabus to show you one other thing and tell you one other digression a note on academic Integrity it's in here somewhere
 academic fraud is the bane of our existence
 add a football player in my class several years ago and I not academic conversation because in the bowl game prior to the spring semester is in my class this kind of football team was flagged for three personal foul penalties on three consecutive plays 15 30 45 boom boom boom and play in the bowl game is that unusual
 SNL what's up with that
 you might have heard that about class
 well I don't think there's any small dose of academic fraud you can strive for age you can strive to get hundreds on quizzes and fail to do that you can strive for Honor however
 and fail a quiz and still get honor
 if you are we had people fudge on these four points Greg Abbott deals I'll have somebody turn them in action with one year I don't know if somebody ripped a piece of paper in half and wrote the Greg Abbott thing on each half and put one name on one half and one on the other and we can fit them together like a puzzle piece and saw the two names
 hello McFly maybe you don't belong in college and if somebody else's exam on a 50-point exam that if you want doesn't count anyway
 well again but more than that
 I think strive for Honor memes mean something important because you can strive for honor and fail and still catch honor
 you can fail and lose out on honor are you can succeed and lose out on honor and I think you lose out more but I tell you a story I got a conferences all the time sometimes my wife goes with me sometimes not this is story about a guy that goes to a conference his wife isn't a lawn right and he's at a bar
 having a drink after the conference and somebody else and a woman comes up and says I will give you a million dollars to spend the night with me that's sort of odd that never happens to guys sometimes it happens to women looking to spend the night with me
 why not right so that happens and the next morning she gives him twenty bucks
 and he goes what's that for appreciate the night it was fun do you think I am
 we've established what you are when you find your four point Greg Abbott
 we'd established what you are when you cheat on the SAT no difference there is no difference. That's my academic Integrity we've already established that you learn you've done that we will file a report we don't adjudicate cheating all we do is note it and file a report and even if you're not cheating and we know what appears to be the appearance of impropriety we file a report you don't want you don't want that report you want to strive for Honor
 fair enough I guess that's sort of the adult way of saying just do what you agreed to do and if you screw up and you fail
 adult up and do better next time simple just accept accept what is and move on
 okay I was at the pop quiz wasn't I
 by a show of hands for these 10 true or false questions and I want everybody to vote
 who would say true
 lower class people are more likely to the crimes that upper-class people end up
 I have a little more on the other side social disorganization disintegrates
 false

 false
 I'd be a hard sell to your parents when you get a new roommate I guess it'll be better mom truly Born Again Christians less likely to divorce
 actually done pretty well you know why they're all false
 home in that we have hardcore sociological data that shows that they're not true they are not they are not not not let me give you the cliff notes of people more likely to commit some types of crimes petty theft
 illegal
 at the same one
 where was I
 the type of crime varies by class
 who got their identity theft themed anybody credit card twice
 the IRS
 I got most of my you know
 Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company yesterday was fined $530 for fraudulently perpetuating addiction and death
 that's not lower class people get the idea what type of crime is different
 natural disasters people panic and social marketing organization disintegrates who's from Houston and remembers Harvey
 wow that was amazing I meant did you find who would agree that there was a level of kinship that came out of that that was somewhat surprising every now and then
 don't you love the Cajun Navy
 rednecks and bass boats from Louisiana showing up just to be helpful that was awesome
 that's one of the coolest things I have seen as an observer in society is the Cajun Navy actually taking it upon themselves to miss work and just show up to be helpful
 and save lives I was cool and that's what happens far more than the stereotype of looting convenience stores etc etc this is this has happened in the last class 2
 15 years ago I've been doing this for 25 Almost 100% say true on this now less than half for an hour because it happened for the first time in that sense last class my theory is this is that the conversation we're having in the public sphere today about diversity and immigration and Welfare and white-collar crime and etc etc has got that question under review and I think that's a good thing and here's why I think that's a good thing that's the question of all 10 for which we have the most persuasive data and I'm not going to give you the details in Thursday's lecture so that's a preview of Coming Attractions it's in it's it's very intriguing to me that the percentage of people in your situation that said that's true is
 dramatically and the only thing I can tie it to is that the content of that discussion is in the news a lot or at least things tangential to it and can I find that rather intriguing and somewhat edify
 regular churchgoers are less likely to be prejudiced Martin Luther King said 11 Sunday morning is the hour of the week where we are least likely to encounter somebody so out of our religious experience we are least likely to have what really overcomes Prejudice and that is personal contact with somebody who's a little different you know that's you know that that's true when AIDS is not a concept anymore it's
 your best friend's mom's cousin or something like that you know
 what's Roman Catholics oppose birth control honestly they don't who's Roman Catholic so you would know what I mean when I say the most u.s. Roman Catholics a green almost unanimously on the Virgin birth of divinity of Christ the transubstantiation of the elements at the mass and the Catholics nevermind
 you know what though on the subject of birth control at the old guy in Rome wants to legislate that he can fund the college fund it just makes no sense there's a practical override to that that's just what that this was the research reports what's more interesting than that is the most interesting why are you a good Catholic
 are you Catholic yes do you oppose birth control no are you a good Catholic yes
 that's called cognitive dissonance resolving an internal conflict based on a religious value overwritten by the practicalities hey you know what is transubstantiation
 and yet hey come on that's what's interesting about that kind of research the income gap between male and female workers it was still around 60 65% on a dollar for women out to about $0.80 on a dollar but not to the point of equality I'll tell you why later in the turn each one of these is in a sense a whole lecture in the class
 just children much more likely to live in single-parent households now than they were Century go that is the only question here that I would consider a trick question almost all of you said that's true when you said that's true your theory had something to do with the increasing divorce rate
 unequivocally the case way more divorces in a century ago a century ago way more moms and dads dying from the flu
 so the reason for the creation of single-parent household is different but we got the same number
 pick it up from a different point of you not just divorce there's more than one way does it work
 I love this one principle of church and state prevents religious leaders from using their position to endorser opposing political campaign until 1949 for any religious leader or any leader in a nonprofit organization to stand up and say vote for that guy and was mostly guys because they believe what we believe and so on illegal to do that doesn't mean it doesn't happen to have is a lot but church and state has nothing to do with it this year Texas history Senator incidentally vice president present but center of the state of Texas is running for re-election against a guy named Allan Shivers and Allan Shivers was getting a lot of money to run this campaign from religiously-based nonprofit organizations
 LBJ said I can fix that and he did he walked into a nearly empty Senate chamber
 when the debate was going on over a budget bill that has to pass and he attached a little amendment to it that nobody read a remembered saying religiously-based nonprofit organizations and leaders cannot openly endorse or oppose political candidates and churches fell into this not because they're religious the federal government pays them to stay in business and that's the logic behind it
 nobody Reddit it passed on a Voice vote and in the matter in a matter of hours LBJ cut off his opponents money supply but that's the way a lot of things sometimes happen in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election that from the Trump campaign especially that they were going to resend the Johnson Amendment so that favor Free Speech call the Johnson amendment is not been rescinded to this point but it's become under review in the last couple of years Mi to my prospective partner
 will you move in with me if that means the same emotionally is will you marry me in other words that's it you and me till death do us part then the satisfaction levels about the same if the rationale for will you move in with me is financial or hormonal not necessarily the case so the overriding issue is commitment and finally
 there is so much that goes into the death of a marriage that you can describe it to just religious belief I'll tell you this in so many words later in the term poverty is what kills marriages
 questions
 I one more bit on anything questions on anything
 this is something will come back to these are things that a lot of people you know I think heard absolutely right and we will subject them to further review
 I want to illustrate last and just one more way what it means to be a sociologist and what's at stake sometimes and how we do this with one more little role-play I'm going to give you an observation
 I'm going to ask you to refine the observation and I'm going to ask you to apply it to another question okay here's the observation a man is running down the street now. Is limited that in your mind to half the population a man is running down the street stay with me here
 now why might that be happening somebody just give me a reason why a man might be running down the street is late for work
 exercising Wild
 working out
 summit racing and maybe it's the cars
 Steve Harvey play Family Feud late exercising running from the cops right now what's refined or observation for a minute what other data points might you notice that lead you to somewhat definitively conclude that the man running down the street is exercising what else we looking at
 attire shoes earbuds of course I'll take over stating the obvious for 200 right
 chasing a bus that you write simple how do we know he's being chased by the cops
 little bastard got a TV
 okay
 observation a refined analysis a new question
 imagine 500 American adults like you know
 which of those three guys
 exercise guy late guy or TV set guy do you think you'd get
 a plurality of judgment is also he's not only exercise late or TV set guy he's also the 20 year old black guy which one is it
 thanks a lot
