morning everybody
 so I have a question
 have you heard about this new product at Bed Bath & Beyond corduroy pillows have you heard about that corduroy pillows they're making headlines
 as it were okay this is the second of for presentations in this segment mostly dealing with matters at the micro-level we talked last time about socialization becoming civil social well-adjusted rule keeping law-abiding people essentially
 today we're going to talk about rule-breaking Social Deviant sort of the inverse of that are there any questions about the content of the socialization lecture
 to this point
 okay let me then also point out that the next test is looming we have this lecture today and then a presentation on Thursday and a presentation on Tuesday and a week from Thursday is exam to its October first second something like that there will be questions on it that begin which sociological perspective and all three perspectives will be in play
 they'll be a review for that test on the Wednesday afternoon prior a week from tomorrow also in the media and communication building room 281 same time same place so that's what's happening and the whole course will go just like that will have a test for your for presentations another test in a review prior
 but let me just briefly talked about deviance and social control this is one of those presentations where they'll be lines on the outline that we're going to get through in like 2 minutes and then there are pieces that are going to go on for 20 or 25 minutes so it's just going to be one of those things
 when you hear the word deviant you tend to think of bad person or negative judgment
 from a sociological point of view deviance is a description it's just a it's just a nominal term we use to describe something that people do that is against the rules
 doesn't
 consider on its face whether the rules make any sense but just are the rules being broken that's called social deviance
 so it's less judgment than it is a description and I think that distinction is important we're going to be late for that I think in a couple of different ways if there are rules in the world there are rewards and punishments for keeping a break in it when we've already talked about this so I'm just going to revisit this one point or just a couple of minutes rules are in place to maintain order in classrooms and also maintain social order
 laws are the rules we write down to maintain social order informal rules we talked about folkways we have four ways of dealing with rule Keepers and rule-breakers we can reward somebody informally for keeping the rules just bump high five hug smile we can reward them formally for keeping the rules and a test promotion raise in salary gold watch at the end of a career
 formal positive we can punish people informally for breaking rules we can send them to the room we can give them a dirty look at cetera or we can punish them formally we can give them a speeding ticket or an F on a test or put them in jail that's just social control rules breaking rewards and punishments for that
 one more thing
 every once in a while there's a rule in place maybe even a widely understood formal law that needs to go people can be rewarded for breaking rules that need to go away Rosa Parks name ring a bell
 she's not on your list of Heroes redefined hero
 Rosa Parks lived in Montgomery Alabama in the 50s she just not too long ago within the last 10 years I think our life ended in Detroit
 she did not wake up one crummy morning intending to change the world but that's what happened she woke up one crummy morning got ready to do her crummy job and
 steel herself for the crummy process by which she had to get to that crummy job that is riding a bus to white people's houses that you spent the day cleaning up after okay Jen wake up trying to change the world she woke up with sore feet she had corns and went to work anyway and after a long day coming back on the bus the world chain. A lot of people think she just wouldn't move to the back of the bus and that in a sense is true
 but there's a greater level of detail and Nuance in bus laws that I want you to understand so that you know how insanely stupid and ridiculous and hurtful and humiliating and unjust
 this process was if you were a non-white person in Montgomery Alabama and you wanted to take the bus anywhere
 you have to get on the bus and you had to do a little radar sweep
 there was a white line behind the ear halfway down and if there were seats in the front of the bus you could sit there that was a concession to you know being egalitarian and being polite you can sit in the front and you could stay seated in the front until every other seat was taken and another white person got on the bus and then you had to move okay
 there's one other little feature to the law that was truly insane let's imagine you're a non-white person you get on the bus and you put your money in cuz you have to put your money and that's where they collect it and you see that there are no seats in the front and you have to sit in the back of the bus cuz you're not on what it was
 it was illegal in a sense so that was common custom that you couldn't walk through the white you couldn't get that close to white people proud of you couldn't walk through the crowd
 if you got on the bus and you saw there were no seats in the front and you had to sit in the back here to put your money in the bus collection thing then step off the bus and then you go to the back door and get on and find a cedar a place to stand is it beyond your imagination to consider the possibility that a person in that scenario gets on the bus puts the money in has to get off and by the time they get to wear the back of the bus it used to be there
 happened a lot almost all the time
 baby you don't make it to work
 no wonder with sore feet Rosa Parks that had enough of this so she got on the bus which was nearly empty sat until it was full and then a white person got on and the bus driver stopped the bus and I'm sure he meant this in a good Christian way
 he basically looked at this tired
 in pain after American woman into blank lady get your blankety-blank in the black baccarat cetera
 and she just said no and they call the police I got to be a big thing and that kicked into place the Montgomery Bus Boycott
 and that started
 chicken over Domino's in the civil rights movement and Rosa Parks because she didn't decide to change the world she just changed the world cuz it's badly needed changing and she did so by Leading by example
 deviance social control that's it questions
 theoretically then why is there deviance
 this is one of the most counterintuitive that is it just doesn't on the face of it doesn't make any sense and yet we're going to parse it for a little while for the functionalist point of view is useful it serves a purpose and it's a functionalist perspective because in a society understood through the set of lenses nothing persists if it doesn't have a reason it devolves out of the system so because we have deviance there must be some use for an actually three ways in which deviance is useful one it helps us clarify moral boundaries helps us distinguish between what's in bonds and what's out and if you know what's out of bounds you know where the line is and you need to stay in bounds in order to be a law-abiding Norm keeping person
 put it on put it this way how many do ever in your life had someone who is a role model authority figure say to you know what you shouldn't spend so much time with that person they're a bad influence
 they live out of bounds right and you shouldn't spend time with them cuz that's where you'll wind up
 I'm just curious who is the kid that other people's parents talked about so don't play with you who's that kid and you're proud of it are you not sir not sleeping out especially
 in any case you get the idea my dad used to tell me it's a well son I suppose we could always use you for a bad example
 I have a purpose don't be like that guy all right
 in the sixties one of the members of US Supreme Court was named Potter Stewart associate Justice Mr Justice Stewart and he is famous for having essentially written this part of this nature for all sociology teachers for all time when the court was trying to decide the distinction between free speech and pornography and that's a tough one
 free speech is Ironclad First Amendment kind of stuff pornography distasteful potentially violent lot of bad things come of it Potter Stewart said this I can't Define pornography
 but I know it when I see it I know it when I see it so my sick mind conjures up 9 old guys sitting around a conference table piled high with you see it here Potter I don't know let me look
 let me look again
 I know it when I see it knows I know what's out of bounds so we can keep
 what we need in bounce that's the purpose for one purpose of social deviance secondly
 as a country we talked about this with durkheim and suicide as a country we were never really more one
 the president's approval rating was never hire before or since roughly September 15th 2001
 December 10th 1941 pick your horrible day in history when everybody was affected by an attack and so we create a sense of unity in the Oklahoma City bombing are created a sense of unity as it were so that's the second purpose or at least the second dimension in which deviance Hazard as a purpose or is useful in some way
 currently it can generate a deliberative process of social change
 the entertainment industry I think is a good example of this way things are really different now in terms of what we can see what we can use in an act and how it's received by other people
 Elvis Presley was showcased to America most prominently on The Ed Sullivan Show that was a late night prime-time variety show in the 50s and this young kid from Tupelo Mississippi came on and sang hound dog in the whole country went nuts but he was only shown from the waist up because he had a kind of a gyrating dance to what he saw him if if the ladies in the audience of the Ed Sullivan Show saw Elvis swiveling His hips that would just create chaos
 seriously
 now we have Miley Cyrus you know on commercials
 that's been an evolutionary process we have collectively agreed overtime that we go from Elvis to the wrecking ball
 in incremental ways right and maybe not even widely distributed George Carlin one of my sort of ideological mentors in public speaking and the creative use of language in his way of claiming of talking about ideas making people think
 he could not
 do a stand-up show before HBO week we did not have ready access to that before home box office because the theory was you couldn't just couldn't turn on the six television and be subjected to George Carlin's profanity that would be illegal in fact even wrote a piece called the seven words you can't use on television which is a classic of both comedy and culture and you should look it up but with HBO that's what I'm saying the entertainment industry can change we wouldn't have George Carlin without Lenny Bruce who was carted off a comedy club stage in the 50s in New York in handcuffs for using the f word hard to imagine that would happen anytime today so the purpose of deviance to push the envelope there's a lyric and one of my favorite Todd Snider songs called the only way you know you've gone far enough
 is to go too far and back up then you know you've gone far enough for lights evolutionary social change backup negotiate
 so that's the third purpose or usefulness social deviance why is there deviance from a functionalist point of view with useful questions
 clarify moral boundaries promote social Unity facilitate social change
 another somewhat lengthy piece then why is there deviance in society from a conflict point of view deviance is inevitable
 to put it bluntly if playing by the rules doesn't help Break The Rules Rosa Parks
 if the rules are untenable if the rules are unachievable you may have no choice in an area where jobs are scarce legitimate jobs are scarce in kids need to make money for school supplies and help pay the electric bill the drug dealers are always hiring
 sometimes it's a rational choice to break the law
 a better way I think of describing that and getting you one little sound bite on this piece the guy named Jeffrey reiman REI man wrote a skinny little book actually to philosophy book that was often used in may still be last I checked it was it it's 12 or 13th edition
 sometimes used as a secondary text in criminology courses in the title of the book hits the heart of deviance is inevitable why because the rich get richer and the poor get prison the rich get richer and the poor get prison reiman argued and have as our intended purpose
 the aggressively over incarceration of non-whites and they almost 100% recidivism rate if that was our goal if those were our goals we would design the system we have why the rich get richer and the poor get prison and argued that the criminal justice system is actually a sequence of events
 between which is discretion
 anybody he argued anybody can come under scrutiny by law enforcement for anything at anytime
 minding your own beeswax Depending on time and Circumstance you can still come under review
 so
 the under review people for a rhyming argue and the population should demographically
 look exactly like the under review population otherwise the general population not so
 the prison population is overwhelmingly non-white disproportionately non disproportionately non way young male
 younger
 ethnically a disproportionate and malar than the rest of the population
 and I'm just wondering how can can you turn male into an adjectives I don't know
 Arnold Schwarzenegger is mailer than Elton John I guess you can do that
 hey Rocket Man was a great movie
 so anybody can come under surveillance general population not everybody upon further review from surveillance gets arrested maybe good question but then you some exit the system son get arrested not everyone gets arrested gets indicted an indictment is what happens after you're under arrest police report is sent to a prosecutor and the prosecutor decides whether there's enough evidence to hold you for trial or negotiation something not everyone gets indicted some assistant mother is every step of the way some move further down the road and some leave the system surveillance arrest indictment not everyone that gets indicted gets convicted summer another to the difference between not guilty and innocent innocent means you can do it
 not guilty of the Hallmarks of Criminal Justice System are presumed innocent until you're proven guilty and if they can't prove you did it on the state then you are not necessarily Edison temperature at least not guilty right and you exit the system and even those who are adjudicated guilty not all of them go to prison some are put on probation some are fine and so on summer house arrest and Ryan argues it's not even the most serious offenders that wind up in prison versus those of pay heavy fines witness casual drug use in the eighties and nineties you could get a life sentence in California for 3
 what would now be misdemeanor instances of casual marijuana use there was a 3 strike and you're out law at that time example of how the process is inherently biased that was his point Rich get richer and the poor get prison now a little while ago when I said that anybody could come under review or surveillance for anything at anytime I have a story I quit the ministry full-time stop drinking for quite a while
 got divorced bought a motorcycle kind of midlife crisis you know little red scooter
 I know there are mailer motorcycles that you can buy but none the less in between going back to grad school to do this I was a counselor alcohol and drug treatment programs in inpatient intensive outpatient program and I was just one of those one of the counselors people could have jobs and then come to treatment for the end of the day I decided I would take my little red scooter out into the countryside and forgot tonyia Illinois which was any place other than Chicago deeply Royal West Central Illinois photography as a hobby of mine I've got a brand new camera I know there are things you can do with your time to take pictures of birds and flowers but I was on my little red scooter going to go do that all right
 and I got off the main road onto the Farm to Market Road turn the left on the dirt road and another dirt road over the top of the hill was this area
 with a creek nice place to have a picnic lunch which I did all by my lonesome take a pictures of birds and flowers so I spent a couple hours doing that time to go back to work my scooter was parked over the top of a rise on the dirt road and here's where the story gets interesting every word of this is exactly true as it happened I go up the rise a little bit and I'm literally 10 miles from any level of Commerce or civilization Beyond dirt road and behind my little red scooter is a state patrol car
 interesting volume doing wrong what do you care if I noticed right away that while it's not pointing at me his pistol is in his hand I keep walking to stop when do the Hat
 I stopped turn around okay put your hands on your head yes sir they fish has my wallet out of my pocket at this point I'm coming what is up with this he looks in my wallet fortunately for me this is what he sees this was the wallet I had in my pocket that day do what I got
 that is a police chaplains badge wow nice I was a volunteer police chaplain he goes
 suddenly the whole dynamic of this moment changes is it well you've been out here a while a couple hours to be named a factory shot and killed his ex-wife her boss to other people was seen leaving the scene wearing a black coat
 probably I've been chilling out of town about then with my little helmet on and a black coat probable cause
 so of all of the interesting labels I've ever had in my life is absolutely true you know Pastor Professor spouse ex-spouse grandparent on the list
 from my point of view about two minutes from his about an hour entry gate right I quickly left the system but you can imagine there would be other attributes and other action that individuals who were equally innocent of that would have different sorts of alkanes the chaplains bad was a big deal. Fortunately for me
 so anybody come under surveillance for anything and you could be a homicide suspect whether you've done anything to that effect or not
 the rich get richer and the poor get prison the general population the prison population are extraordinary different in their demographics deviance is inevitable questions
 okay we got a laundry list of terms and I will point out to you that the case example in this outline it's not the War on Drugs it's something different that I introduced a couple years ago you think I adjust the outline with you any good teacher would have done that so you can remember that for course evaluation time it's okay
 there's several different types of crime the most common the entrance of the crimes that we understand are called index crimes
 if for any reason you move to another town come to school in Lubbock and you want to know something about the time you might want to check out the crime rate for the crime rate is not the rate of every single crime what's the rate of index crimes crimes are called index crimes because they appear in a published index online now in What's called the uniform crime reports published by the justice department and the index how frequent per capita or per thousand population
 this specific a crime to occur there for index crimes against property and for index crimes against people the index crimes against people are homicide
 physical assault
 sexual assault
 and robbery
 go to the four index crimes that are typically perpetrated against people homicide murder physical assault sexual assault and robbery
 there are also four different index crimes that are perpetrated but largely against property these are arson burn something up
 burglary theft and auto theft
 4 crimes against property arson burglary theft and auto theft interesting that of the eight
 four of them are similar robbery burglary Theft Auto
 good judeo Christian religious types only need one Val shalt not steal right you hear about that every once in a while we had to put the Ten Commandments in the courthouse that govern how we behave
 if you might be interested to know that only three of The Ten Commandments are actually crimes
 huh
 only three. Shalt not steal is one of them. Shalt not kill is another one
 and if you religious types who might have memorized the Ten Commandments for Sunday School in 3rd grade
 do you remember or can you
 recall the third of the Ten Commandments it's actually a crime
 bearing false witness perjury lying to Congress it's in the Ten Commandments and that's the only other one
 anyway my point is there are distinctions that are made of levels of culpability in val shalt not steal is probably the most benign let's it I do got a backpack right there in front of me imagine there's some cool stuff in there may be a little MacBook Air that I just badly need right
 if you because you're careless leave the room and leave your backpack there and I swipe that MacBook Air that's called fat right now if you leave with your backpack and I follow you home creepy right and I see you go into your house with the backpack and then come out without it still trapped mine that I have backpacks in the house I break in the house steal the backpack in the laptop that's called burglary all right. That laptop and I see you walking up the stairs and I come up behind you and throw you down the stairs and grab that backpack that's not only robbery it's a salt right which I would never do cuz you're bigger and stronger than me as is every guy in this room so you drink all your backpacks robbery
 now
 at this point in this presentation about 10 or 12 years ago for some reason I had too much coffee or not enough but I decided to go off on a rant and I wandered over to the conflict side of the room and I started hugging the wall like a boot-licking Marxist and started talking about auto theft we have every Polly every Police Department every major city in this country has an auto theft task force they have a subset of First Responders and law enforcement officers that do nothing but police they investigating and trying to prevent car theft and I'm over here on the conflict side of the wall going rich people
 cuz they're the ones with expensive cars right, just ask how many of you actually own all by yourself not with the bank a car that's worth stealing
 who drives the equivalent of a 2002 POS
 North EOS stands for peace of
 I'm going in or what
 if they steal your Bimmer Drive the Porsche
 break-in at this point in this rant and I am you know I'm off the deep end on this which was wrong lightweight and says dr. cook you think there's another way to look at this and I said hell no I said I don't know
 are you guys even if you got a POS and you work at Walmart and somebody boost your POS you can't get to work and that sets in motion a whole other sequence of events like maybe you lose your job and your kid doesn't get picked up from school that they're etcetera etcetera actually worse for someone driving a POS probably then the guy that can just you know Drive the Porsche today all right and he said it's dis functional
 it's dysfunctional and I'm going
 are you you're right and I promise that person that day
 every time I did this bit I would own up to being reactionary
 and tell you how I was sort of drawn back in by a student who said nothing other than you think there's another way to look at this
 mission accomplished that's what I'm asking you to do and we can debate the whole nuances of that but I think it's that's that that's the best example that's ever happened to me in the classroom of a student rather bravely cuz I was in a bad mood that day rather bravely doing exactly what I'm trying to teach you guys how to do
 what song is this remember the direction
 Scooby Snacks to go real fast
 professional crime in organized crime go together micro and mezzo approach to earning money doing illegal activity a professional criminal has harnessed his or her skills to earn money doing something illegal
 maybe that some may be especially good at taking cars apart and selling the parts maybe you're especially good at identity theft maybe you're especially good at scamming people with fraudulent stories even using something Noble as magic tricks to fool people into giving you money as it were you hold your skills and can earn money by doing an illegal thing I do you just sell it maybe just sell rocks of crack on the street
 you're someone who is home skills and learn how to do something that you can sell and what you're doing is illegal that's called professional crime for probably an organized criminal Enterprise drug cartels child sex ring something like that and so the organized criminal Enterprise is a bureaucracy for doing something or facilitating any illegal Enterprise
 so professional crime is just individuals doing something illegal to earn money organized crime is probably the organization they work for its if the definition is it of it is it's a bureaucracy for illegal activity a bureaucracy for illegal activity and up before the segment is over there's a whole piece on what a bureaucracy is so stay tuned
 so once again that's just the two quick definition professional crime doing something illegal as an individual to make money organized crime a bureaucracy for illegal activity
 can I have a fairly extensive piece on white collar crime now and somebody pointed out in the last class what's the difference between white-collar crime in organized crime associated with quote-unquote respectable legitimate people and businesses corporate crime that one little quick in here
 and I just thought of this about a year ago how we use the terms black and white and what they connotate white collar crime crimes associated with respectable or legitimate Enterprises and yet doing something criminal as opposed to a black market
 same kind of thing but this whole notion of black-and-white which we also apply to distinguish people
 in the connotation I think is not totally lost
 black and white that aside we talked about corporate crime for a minute for several minutes this is the type of crime for which we are most likely to fall victim we are afraid of getting knocked over the head or beaten up or stabbed or had are having our backpacks taken and stuff like that the personal stuff you know we're afraid of that but we're far more likely to be victimized on an individual level by having their identity stolen by a hacker
 but more eat more likely more dramatically and even more consequentially by consumer product safety lapses and outright fraud
 Purdue Pharmaceuticals has been in the news all over the place in the last month or so for its role in producing mass quantities and having means to sell and flooding the market with fentanyl and hydrocodone oxycodone and they have set aside of the Sackler family which is in the Forbes 400 has set aside a couple billion dollars to settle lawsuits and then declare bankruptcy
 oh yeah
 and there's some in there some indication that some of that family money has been funneled into unreachable untraceable offshore bank accounts which it is of itself may not be illegal that certainly has ethical matter so corporate crime is is really in play here and in the Purdue pharmaceutical company Empire the pharmaceutical why would I do that somebody's got a hot internet and knows how to get to Yahoo finance or find the price of a share of stock price of Pfizer stock Pfizer Pharmaceuticals ticker name their ticker symbol is PFE Paul Frank Edward somebody look up the price of Pfizer stock as we speak what is it
 36 and 1/4 OK 10 years ago the Pfizer Corporation was find on since September of 2009 by the operation was fine 2.1 billion dollars at the time it was the largest fine ever leveled against the corporation by the US government for Consumer Fraud Pfizer Corporation settle for that amount of money for its Miss representation of and fraudulent marketing of a drug called bextra bextra you can look it up extra was a sort of a souped-up ibuprofen your grandparents took it for arthritis and a lot of them died from blood clots that Pfizer didn't tell it didn't talk about as much and the other thing they did is there Salesforce went to Physicians all over the country and aggressively said you know what the extra is great for arthritis but it's also great for this this that in that which had not been tested or approved by the FDA but
 in a capitalist market like the US and a healthcare system that reflects it any licensed physician can prescribe any legal pharmaceutical product for any reason he or she thinks it might help and advisor said that extra is great for arthritis but it's also guarantee it'll do anything
 I took a while to say
 and so they're prescribing it like popcorn and people were dying and they litigated the illegality of that for several years until finally they said okay we'll pay 2.1 billion and it became like a cost of doing business I was
 I wasn't tuned to the pharmaceutical industry have been all my life and I bet that was training in about eighteen and it went down to about 60 baby 15 and a half
 that was ten years ago pretty much to the day so Pfizer stock is selling at a bargain after this line comes through at $16 a share let's say you bought a thousand shares of that so you had $16,000 10 years ago today is today what did you got $36,250 who would take that deal now in a Heartbeat by said you could make $26,000 on a $10,000 investment today in 10 years who take that deal right now
 I would
 visors not her it's almost cost me any business and you would think that might be part of the reason why I about 4-5 years later the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company
 was find the exact same amount for doing the exact same thing about a drug called Risperdal which was even more heinous in my view because Risperdal was prescribed as a powerful psychotropic for deeply ill mental patients that were institutionalized
 Johnson & Johnson set up great for that Risperdal is good for institutionalized mental patients but again it also has guaranteed not to and they were prescribing it like that and people were suffering serious side effects
 how can you be victimized who's from Houston again and God love you for getting flooded again
 and I hope your houses are okay I thought about I thought about you I did that's also the home of the Enron Corporation the infamous Enron Corporation and on the subject of Val shalt not bear false witness
 the Enron Corporation lied about the health of their company they lied about the amount and source of their profits they lied about the source in scopus are liabilities cuz I didn't have a product they just sold energy contracts they brokered energy contracts and we're aboard essentially a middleman and they were at one point the seventh largest company in the US and Ron filled with the Astros play
 Enron stock was selling for about $100 a share at its apex and within a month or two of the wheels falling realizing that the Enron Corporation lied to analysts about profit margins that cause their stock prices to go up it took about two months to go from 102 less than $5 a month now what did that mattered matter to people about Enron stock but also matter to every Enron employee who had the Holdings of their company provided pension fund in Enron stock
 the sound like a familiar story to anybody from Houston or Denise if anybody have get bankrupted not just by losing their job because here's what happened to real people that maybe you really know
 you're sitting pretty 6 months before it hits the fan with Enron you've got $150,000 job as a chief assistant to an assistant chief mid-level managers making good money you have a $1000000 retirement portfolio having in it 10,000 shares of Enron stock of hundred dollars a share that's awesome now you can't spend it you can't sell it
 because it's a part of the pension fund or employee retirement fund that you can't get in till you're 65 but you know what you can do
 with a million-dollar retirement portfolio you can borrow against it a bank will happily loan you $750,000 for a nice little 3-bedroom near The Woodlands
 if you've got a $1000000 retirement account
 sign here no money down until suddenly they know and you know that your $1000000 retirement fund is now worth $10,000
 and the bad calls in your mortgage
 that's what happens
 because they lied and the Arthur Andersen accounting from swore to it and run
 can you stand one more personal story
 my encounter with a fraudulent company had to do with the Ford Motor Company
 I am I told you I set my life on fire about when I was 35 when I was 22 I was about to get married to one of the pieces of my life that caught fire a few years later my marriage don't get me wrong we were mismatched she wasn't is a good person I wasn't am a good person who we shouldn't have gotten there in the first place Etc but we are about to get married in June of 1975
 I don't have a car I drive my dad's 1967 POS that wasn't working that day and I needed to run errands in the run-up to the wedding so I dropped my fiance off at work strip mall kind of places I had the car that her father bought for her a month ago for the college graduation it was a Ford Pinto
 she named the car please she named the car after the winner of the Kentucky Derby horse Pinto Etc so I've got custody of the child
 I drop her off I get as far as the driveway to make a right turn onto the major Street going pack it and pushed out into the street T-boned but the back end of the pinto got destroyed
 now I have to report this to her dad and he basically goes what did you do to provoke the dump truck nothing I found out later much later that it was a good thing I got rear-ended by a dump truck because it hit at high wiped out the hatchback destroyed most of the backseat it didn't hit the gas tank which Ford Pintos were disproportionately vulnerable to exploding in rear-end collisions
 I got hit any any car any car any truck if you hit it hard enough in the back will explode cuz that's where the explosives are but there are design requirements and tolerances and safety mechanisms to minimize the likelihood of that and Ford Motor Company knows what those are and the pinto was out of whack
 so they held a secret meeting they got together and said the pinto we've discovered and they discovered it because they started blowing up on people started dying and getting May
 well what are we do we could recall and retrofit the pinto well it turned out that the retrofit was to Simply put about a $60 gas or $60 metal plate in front of gas tank that wouldn't keep it from exploding but it would prevent it from exploding so fast all they had to do it could bring it into Tyler to make it legal that one selling car how much per 60 bucks let's do the arithmetic that came up with a number with several zeros in it right and a statistician goes wait a second
 let's look at this from another point of you must have been a sociology student
 not every pentose going to be in a rear end collision almost none of them you know less than 5% of their entire life will ever be in a rear end collision where you can do this with me way more accuracy than you think they're really good at the store called actuaries to hit by dump trucks okay fair and even the ones that blow up not all of them are going to be fatal
 so let's figure out how much it's going to likely cost us to litigate settlements for people who sue us from having their Pinto blown up
 they came up with another number it had a lot of zeros on it but one less
 I'm out
 does anybody think that's vaguely wrong
 it actually is it illegal if you cannot withhold that kind of information from the public it's up it's a legal to do that
 well I want the only company the only Corporation I think before or since to actually be indicted
 for manslaughter they actually got invite indicted for homicide and paid mass quantities if either still in business that's the kind of crap you're far more likely to be and Ron Weiser Purdue and the list goes on
 white collar crime
 turn addition to being homicide suspect for 2 minutes of my life I was almost a homicide victim
 kind of sobering after a while
 quick thing on what are called victimless crimes the debt the textbook definition of victimless crime is a crime for which the only victim is also the perpetrator is also the
 the typical textbook list of victimless crimes include illegal drug use personal illegal drug use illegal gambling and also prostitution which by the way are legal in some form and I would say they are not victims that's a philosophical thing if you ask anybody who in their family has a dear one that's an addict they will tell you they are not the only victim of that behavior
 prostitution is kind of an organized criminal Enterprise I mean you could argue that that someone who sells their body for temporary use as it were is a professional and there are working girls and working guys and George Carlin by the way came up with a great one-liner calling into question the illegality of that saying why is it illegal to sell something that you we can perfectly legally give away
 you know what that is 10 minutes of your time etcetera
 I don't think that's entirely victimless either the opposite point of view comes from radical feminist who would say that any woman who is led to the conclusion by her culture or any man to want one of the other who is led by his or her culture II think that's the only way that they can make money has been co-opted by a kind of patriarchy doesn't work so the point here is that victimless crime this is it's in something of a philosophical debate who really is the victim you can't get gas in Louisiana without having the opportunity to play a slot machine it's legal everywhere so what effect it is argued I think persuasively that the proliferation of slot machines in gas stations in the sale of lottery tickets disproportionately affects people with less money you don't try and get you know something of a windfall for cheap and you never win almost as it were so there's that
 victimless crime questions to this point I've got a whole new piece on something that is not the war on drugs and it's going to take the rest of the time so there are any questions about anything I have said so far
 terms definitions by flashcard material in this lecture okay
 scratch out the War on Drugs case example
 campus carry and gun violence
 text built this piece three years ago maybe for I didn't bust 2015 for the whole question of Campus carry of firearms came to the fore and we were all serving The Faculty roll serving this faculty Senate came out against it faculty was somewhat mixed all the largely opposed student body was somewhat next mildly oppose Fairmount in favor and Hunter never owned a gun my only experience firing a firearm was when one of my buddies handed me a single shot 36 inch barrel 12 gauge Goose gun and said want to go skeet skeet shooting after about two of those in my shoulder being totally out of whack I said this isn't any fun
 so that's about it so I decided I would investigate well I have the results of my investigation for you and I give this to you simply to peruse and maybe given your own thought on the handouts page there's a link here to what I call Campus carry and it says here there's another link is at the text of a letter written to Governor Abbott by the guy who at the time of the campus carry thing was the chancellor of University of Texas University Texas the largest campus in the country largest university in America the chancellor is the head of that significant skin in the game and campus-carry wouldn't you think from this guy
 his name is no longer Chancellor but he's still around you may have seen him on CNN is a political commentator now his name is William mcraven
 not just Uncle Bill but retired four-star Admiral William mcraven former Commander US Special Forces former Navy SEAL he was directing the bin Laden death raid in the situation room with the president and now he was Chancellor of University of Texas more about guns and violence than I do
 d-mannose vaguely more about guns and violence in any other American he's against he wrote a letter to Greg Abbott saying this is a bad idea and here's why I thought you know I'm against it and for those reasons essentially there are two reasons he said one just do the arithmetic any time you introduced into any complex system a greater level of lethal violence you will have guess what more lethal violence college-age population pretty vulnerable to emotional issues drug issues drinking let's put more guns in there no he says let's not we'll see more suicides will see more Reckless shootings of people getting drunk etcetera etcetera and the purpose of Campus carry the I think legitimately arguable purpose of Campus carry is to say in a situation where there's a bad guy with a gun coming through that door would leave me the first sin
 duck in the story might be stopped by a good guy with a gun all right let's talk about that for a while
 first of all it's a good guy with a gun is sitting where you are and someone comes in that door with an AR-15
 in about a half a second all hell is going to break loose
 and suddenly they're going to be people everywhere and you may take six or seven seconds to get the pistol out of your backpack by which time there are 10 people between you and
 you're right about I would say 30 or 40 ft
 if I hadn't if I'm doing target practice and there's a Target on that door and I have a handgun right here that's again of roughly the same distance maybe a little longer if my aim is off by 1/8 of an inch I'm going to miss the door it's off by a half an inch I'm going to hit you just because of the angle it is extraordinary really difficult to accurately and effectively shoot a handgun much less under extreme pressure in the company of someone who is totally the element of surprise and a bigger gun
 and if all that is not convincing when SWAT shows up there looking for a guy with a gun that could be you they don't know where the good guy is
 so that was those were the two reasons that mcraven essentially said this is a bad idea and I tend to agree
 I have had numerous members of current and former members of the military current and former First Responders tell me that I am at least correct on how hard it is to effectively shoot a handgun in a situation like that especially and the odds of having something worse happened as a result as opposed to something better just the probabilities don't work so that's on the campus carry thing
 and until a year-and-a-half ago but let me stop just stop there from there cuz I've another I've got the I've got a PostScript to this whole piece for a different and then we got we got 20 minutes and I've got about another 10 minute lecture piece so we've got a couple minutes to talk if you want to if you don't that's fine
 I talked about carrying Donuts always about terrorism and stopping like attacks well that's what he what he said is it raises the possibility of accidental death and also mcraven talked at some length about suicide and just drunk and stupidity you really in any of the suicide rates for military ex military and First Responders are astronomically high in part because of right. Guns and clearly the more guns arguably the more likely something bad will happen before something good that's the argument
 what about having trained for 10
 I would like to hear more of that that's the motto she's what about having trained people in each class first of all I don't know anybody would do that for free so your tuition to go out secondly if you know what I think we've done that and that I would be more willing to listen to that then I would be saying I ought to have a gun or my my grandchild to Middle School teacher I have a gun that to me just seems doubly insane but I mean for those reason but yeah I would listen to that
 and I win are you do you have to get the way the cost-effectiveness of this I mean yes we have high-profile events that occur but
 in any given place on any given day the odds of not of any one of us dying in a classroom shooting any day of very very low how much money do you want to spend to try to prevent that
 kind of
 right right and the band was way higher than the odds of this and then
 if the doctor job is clearly a level of training would help you know I needed that would that would Elevate the odds I had a year or so ago I had a guy who I didn't know anything about where you are and said I've had a I had a Glock in my backpack all semester and I was really say yeah ex-military and I'm real good with it in a sense I mean I still have reservations about the idea that he was 28
 crack-shot I don't know that I would say I don't know that I would have welcomed that but I said okay that's different than what we're generally talking about
 I ended this lecture until a year-and-a-half ago at this point
 and a year-and-a-half ago I will tell you the day I was February 15th 2018 and the reason I know that is because the deviants lecture was scheduled for that day
 the day the the morning after February 14th 2018 the day of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Parkland Florida killing of 17 people with AR-15
 I am I mean this is like 12 hours after this hits the news in this is not just the first time this is 17 people in Florida 500 people in Las Vegas 20 some kids at Sandy Hook and any of the list goes on right and so I used my hour by hour and 15 minutes office our peace I shut the door and just wrote what I was thinking and this is what I am and I haven't added a very much
 I started thinking about where this debate comes from this whole notion of gun violence and and you might put this into one little more relevant, have you noticed how basically we've gone over vaping in the last couple of months because we killed 30 people or whatever right
 let me just start having just one little backdrop
 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed I don't know 25 words that the Second Amendment
 that's the Bedrock of the debate over gun laws in this country very well regulated militia now I know that we been a rebel groups might be called upon to overthrow the well-regulated militia but the US military get 600 billion dollars to win that fight
 every year
 the Pentagon takes 57% of discretionary spending I looked at up now by discretionary spending it means money that the government has to spend on something other than Medicare and Social Security those are no discretion you have to spend at the Pentagon
 since the second amendment was written a few things have changed in our culture women can vote slaves are free among two major ones the colonial army in the in 1776 was essentially a volunteer fire department
 the British are coming grab your guns and let's go
 the most powerful handheld military and civilian weapon in the colonial. Was a single shot Muska that's it to reload it once
 so that's one perspective we also know how to regulate other dangerous things cars
 anytime I think
 we introduce a major change into a system we had to investigate and implement the unknown in terms of the know we know how to do something when the automobile was invented the Model T was the automobiles version of the single shot musket it went about 25 miles an hour it broke down after about 15 miles Etc we had no interstate highway system and no regulations whatsoever we have interstate highways and we have Lamborghinis Porsches and BMWs we have the 4-wheel version of the AR-15 readily available and we have mass quantities of regulations
 because it's dangerous
 we're jammin and trained and licensed drivers we require insurance and registration of cars we know who owns every car we know where they live they have mandated purchasing of redress if they misuse that
 that's not taking your guns that's not even infringing on the rights to own one it's simply saying let's be smart about knowing where they are and who has them
 start at this point a year ago said that
 I'll talk about AR-15 is either which is the civilian version of the military M16 which was invented to give to soldiers whose job it was to take that tool and kill as many human beings as fast as possible that's what the gun is designed to do and it's very good at it a AR-15
 the Florida shooter the Parkland Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter could not legally buy beer in the State of Florida a year and a few days ago. After few days ago he legally bought the AR-15
 and the AR-15 was unknown to the authors of the Second Amendment put the gun regulations don't distinguish between a single shot musket and an AR-15 the French as an absolute and if you give one in the next step will be were coming and seizing your guns and there's a lot to like about Beto O'Rourke but he shouldn't have said we're going to hell yeah we're going to take your AR-15 is that just adds gas
 to the gaslighting insanity
 of not giving an inch
 and here's the thing that bothers me most of all
 well I'm not going to talk about one of the things first there is a distinction between a single shot musket and an AR-15 in the all the families at Sandy Hook in Santa Monica a little water New Mexico Colorado Springs Conyers Georgia San Bernardino California Orlando Florida Las Vegas Sutherland Springs Texas Parkland Florida El Paso Texas
 and the list goes on it gets tiresome after a while in it
 it's almost like a here we go again it's just on the list
 what bothers me the most about the nature of the current gun debate
 is it were scapegoating people with mental illnesses the latest strategy coming from the from the Oval Office is let's put them in institutions pool how do you decide
 and by what criteria I think there is a great wisdom in addressing the Mental Health crisis in the US and certainly the mental health connection to insane violence makes sense but here's what bothers me
 in 2013 the Obama Administration tried to move the gun lobby one in
 tried to move the gun lobby one in on the mental health question
 they wanted to add 75000 people that's all that's a very small percentage of population of thousand people to the mandated background check list 75,000 people they fell into two categories one they were collecting Social Security because of mental health in capacity at the way you tell Adam to the background noise people who had relatives adjudicated by a court legitimately for the same reason 75000 people that bill was introduced in 2013 it was passed and signed into law by President Obama one month after the 2016 election by a lame duck congress and a lame duck President signed into law December 2016 one month after Donald Trump became the president United States by executive order he rescinded that
 so all of the talk coming out of the White House now about dealing with mental health I want to say okay but before we do that how about putting that little regulation back in and he's been
 and I have expected it after just these last two or three that they would at least give that one in back of the 75,000 it has not happened I'm not optimistic it will ever happen
 we live in the world we helped to create and shall not infringe has significant benefits
 making it an absolute
 with the result of 35,000 Orso gun deaths every year and by the way I'm giving you a link here there's a little place you can go to actually find up-to-the-minute statistics on gun incidents in gun deaths in the USA update this every single day and we have had a mass shooting in the US so far this year we have had more mass shootings than we have had days and then they Define a mass shooting as it has a single incident in which three or more people are shot
 and we've had one of those we've had more of those and we have had days that's just the numbers folks and and all I I guess all I'm trying to say
 is we know how to regulate dangerous things
 and the choice to regulate Automobiles and alcohol and in many states now marijuana is rational and reasonable
 and we just have culturally a blind eye to what kills more of us than just about anything else
 so buckle up thank you
