good morning everybody the last time we met I tried to play music in the system didn't work at all now it's having trouble playing half the tracking on the MP3 files that I'm trying to run to the system so we had no music today couple of quick announcements third of for presentations in the section mostly on micro Theory so the next exam will be a week from today now and I miss her has always been other beer review for that on Monday at 4 in masks on 67 and otherwise all else the same
my dad joke question to you today
 how do you soothe a baby alien
 you rock it
 too much right all right before we go to today's presentation when introduce you to my friend Cameron Griffith who is in charge of a study abroad program in the Central American country of Belize and he has a presentation on that program specifically but also something of a commercial for the idea that college is a great time to explore and visit and learn from in about a different culture Cameron Griffith
 everybody has and also need to Call of Duty on June 28th to the chase to take a look at the time frame their two weeks on the ground for 6 credit because I'm some sort of the Jedi Master and tell everybody he absolutely where you read some books can you take an exam
 we are rooted in anthropology but we are also bringing in aspects of human geography and sociology and so you can see their attorney before the ology so that the credits can come in as 3304 you so towards your eye particularly gold getting everybody tryna see how it is it's just put your I need an email address if you want more information just doesn't lock you in anything on a passed out every other row so they can go down and then back to the second one that'll end up over
 it's okay for you to show up in the middle of night so I just want to let you know a little bit about what we do
 subtropical environment and want to work with is a village of chocolate Farmers chocolate actually grows on trees until we take you through the entire process in which is part of the fruit fruit and too far from the processing the old fashioned way to modern techniques for processing and we have discussions about within the framework of the global chocolate cacao market and all the time we're done with running into people from Belgium and some of the California because the world will still go to the beach and I always say to go to Belize and not go to beach
 but not if you go with me because I didn't say that just because that way we'd throughout the course so I do my best to give you a taste of that we talked about with the nephron what we talked about on the ritual activity ritual practices societies and human sacrifice
 some of the other things that we do this program in organic farming and sustainability and decide that all back to globalization we
 pitcher that threw variety of Commodities I already mentioned also coffee Citrus and bananas and you didn't play the song video clip of the audio this work then we'll just move on clearly nobody ever has any technical difficulties of the first time in the history of Texas Tech Medical Center is having audio problems disappear if I get to work
 so we just got a
 sounds good folks
 17 can
 yeah we lost the whole track here so clearly neither of us are to blame so we'll just roll with it is if it's just a purely coincidental that we time it out so that your free day during the program is when Ron Boots and so it during that time you're free to do whatever it is you want to set you up with an offer like you can visit the coral reef snorkel or scuba diving thing and then again one of the things I mentioned before is Brooklyn a culture they're known for their drum 18 and drugging ritual activity and they involve ourselves with that as well as I do we also explore pyramids and if you can see there at the base of that staircase those are people standing there to give you a name
 do I think Ancient Maya Society is well frankly so Kick-Ass it's just my thang on you may not agree but it definitely get a chance to see some of that stuff with radiation is sort of $25 word for cave archaeological exploration we will do some of that I've also work with the government to develop tours of gays and we'll talk about that of course in relation to audit or the component
 with regard to that one of the things that we do in the framework of the geography and geology tourism is in the Explorer different combinations so stay in places like Eco Resorts in the jungle all the way at the high-end hotels to give you a. With the range of options that are available to receive them to believe so we can talk about that we can talk about where do you stay how does where you stay affect your perception to the Country Inn and was available to you and how that impacts maybe to return the clothes that work in the country in Mason types of places just have to be able to swim. Saul requirement
 and I want to point out one thing I'm online on tip would typically see in the fine print and then the tuition is in addition to that with our program cost of the six credits is included in a concert are so huge it really is amazing program quite affordable in relation to some of the other programs that have I just want to call if you cannot go to believe this summer with me no problem but do yourself a favor and go on a study abroad program somewhere even if it's within the United States
 here's the big secret this is the last time that there are going to be a whole bunch of people ready to go out of your way to help you pay for it
 so I really hope you take advantage of that opportunity
 play the information how many do you have current active passports
 that's really good you should have one if you don't because you might wake up one morning and say well you know I've got to take the cat to the vet and pick up the dry cleaning and then maybe I'll go to France or beliefs or someplace you'll have that option at least to be able to see and experience and learn things you can't really learn any other way and that is by immersing yourself in some place that's well it's just different than where you normally spend your time so thanks Cameron appreciate it
 I'm going to reset the board here for just a second then we'll move into our topic
 okay moving forward then and today's topics social structure and interaction that we talked a lot about interaction to this point largely understanding interaction be somewhat subjective that when we encounter one another when we try to figure out what's going on in our world in our lives any given moment we're interpreting it as we go but underneath that are structured elements and components and that's it we're going to talk about today
 I want to take you back to a place that you perhaps can identify with as a child when someone read you a story maybe it was at home parent grandparent who is at the library in the nice Library lady and when I was a child they were all Library ladies maybe not so much now
 read me a story so that's how we're going to start settle and take a breath
 Ellis. You never seen such as curious croquet ground in her life
 it was all ridges and furrows the balls were alive hedgehogs and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand upon their hands and feet to make the arches
 the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarreling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and when stamping about and shouting
 or
 about once a minute
 I don't think they play at all fairly Alice said and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak and they don't seem to have any rules in particular at least there are nobody attends to them
 and you've no idea how confusing it is
 where we been
 we have fallen down the rabbit hole with Alice in Wonderland haven't we
 and the story is so accessible because maybe we don't wander into an environment where the croquet game is involving hedgehogs and flamingos and soldiers and mad Queens
 but we have fallen down rabbit holes when we sort of figured what we know the rules to be like in school and we find ourselves day one at Texas Tech University who felt a little bit rabbit hold that day just a little something different
 I know what the rules of school generally are they seem to be a little different here in class in the dorms I know what the rules are no beer but wait a minute. Everybody attends to that rule so what is the rule you got to figure it out
 social structure are they sort of
 well I don't know how to say other than that's like the Tinker Toys are the Legos underneath our world there are sort of invisible structures that keep us in line isn't were and we interact in more or less predictable ways we have structured interaction in this classroom it's an auditorium it's you know there's a an uphill component to it from where I'm standing for the people in the back and at least see the chairs are nailed to the floor can't move around as much limits are structured interaction
 but we also have kind of cultural social normative Arrangements the elements of social positions and role expectations and then a couple of other things in a way that's a little bit different should not a judgment status is often understood in the English language anyway to be a synonym for Prestige and there is some truth to that even this discussion in this in this way and in this instance status simply means title
 job title
 something that identifies us in a social way a job title Professor is a job title minister is a job title parent-student employer-employee Etc all of these are the labels we wear that identify parts of our lives
 and they generally come in three flavors we have status positions labels titles jobs
 that are ascribed to us and buy that we didn't choose them they more or less became part of our identities the moment we're born age is an ascribed status there is a certificate in an office somewhere in some County that's got your name on it and a very particular time place moment where your life started where you started to get older right after that moment
 we are born into a family and that describes unto us a racial or ethnic Heritage and we are born male or female may be coming to type-c sensually and all of those characteristics age race ethnicity and sex have social connotations twice we are stuck with him and we have to live with whatever that means
 we also achieve titles we achieve the title of college graduate or high school dropout or doctor so-and-so or ex-convict all of these things we do or we we acquire these titles are or labels as a result of something we do or perhaps things we fail to do
 so these are at these are achieved status positions and one more that is just useful because you know all of us sort of lead with what we want other people to know primarily you know if I'm on an airplane or or in some other public place striking up a conversation with a stranger they generally say what what do you do and then you have a the other title I have to actually the sort of fun to be able to pick Professor or Minister especially when I go play golf which I've done on from time to time just bring my golf clubs on a trip go to course I want to play and save hook me up with whoever needs a for right so I'm about to say somebody will say well what are you doing and I ask myself how much God talk has there been on the golf course to this point anybody who's the golfer ever play golf on the golf course
 Techna fit right now not a college professor you know I can't talk I go well actually I'm an ordained Presbyterian Minister and I got to know it's kind of fun to have more than one and you can leave with one or the other what kind of what a master status is imma give you three sort of Technicolor examples of a master status when the Olympic gold medal that would do it when it certainly does a prefix for your first name now Cameron mentioned Michael Phelps he's probably I think if anybody knows one Gold Medal winner it would be Michael Phelps probably because he's one more than anybody else you think of it an Olympic gold medalist not named Michael Phelps anybody
 several but it's not readily come to mine you can be the recipient of the Nobel Prize you can run that through expertise and technology or literature or philanthropy all manners of things you can you can become a Nobel Prize winner
 or you can win the Academy Award you no that's another one and the Oscars telecast is coming up on Sunday and it's been you know kind of interesting and entertaining to see the run up to that let's imagine all of us now imagine imagine your obituary just for a second and imagine that you could have one of those three attached to your name who would pick Olympic gold medalist of those three guys who would pick Nobel Prize Laureate who would pick Academy Award
 thank you that's mine I always have this sort of fantasy that Steven Spielberg's hairdresser's neighbors cousins babysitters coach
 knows him and I would say is in this class and I would say hey tell Uncle Steve that your sociology Professor wants to consider myself something of a performer that's what lecturing is in some ways and that would be mine but none the less now than two but I don't think there are there are two people walking planet Earth right now and I believe only two
 that actually hold two of those three Master statuses Olympic gold medal Nobel Prize Academy Award two people have both have two of those not think they would be the most recognizable people on Earth does anybody have any idea who even one of those two people might be
 that holds either and then holds two of these Academy Award gold medal Nobel Prize
 for a long time I only was aware of one and then a year ago pretty much a year ago now a second person picked up the second of those two things let me give you a hint this most recent member of the two Master status club that I'm the only one that knows exists is a professional retired professional athlete and also a filmmaker so he has won the Academy Award for an animated short subject and won the Olympic gold medal as an athlete anybody know who that is
 not that one would it help if I told you that the Academy Award winning animated short subject was entitled dear basketball
 so the athlete is a basketball player and won the Olympic gold medal playing with Team USA
 Kobe Bryant just a year ago won the Academy Award after having won the gold medal and the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 are the Academy Awards
 would it help if I told you that he was also and you would think these two would be enough former vice president United States
 and I know that is
 then help Al Gore
 every time he'll freaking Gore not a popular sword in Texas where Eco schmico right
 climate change etc etc you should know that one of the world's leading climate scientists is a horn professor at Texas Tech University or name is Katharine hayhoe and you should look her up
 Al Gore share the Nobel Peace Prize with his Eco foundation and he shared the Academy Award for best documentary called An Inconvenient Truth so it's kind of interesting what it means to hold these pretty dramatic job titles and
 to move to the next Point all of these job titles have within them embedded social roles which I call job descriptions
 but they're more accurately social roles are the expectations associated with these job titles Al Gore has been criticized
 for not being especially eco-minded in his own house however this organization does it means to be a professor of Pastor a student apparently a child and so on
 social roles are complicated the job descriptions for the titles and identities we hold can be ambiguous they can be cumbersome or they can be incompatible and that's what we call role ambiguity role strain and role conflict too many expectations I got too much going on at any given moment how many of you are the child of parents
 what is that a trick how many of you are the spouse of another
 can you play anyone in here the parent of a child
 how many of you have jobs paying jobs all of those
 if you know somebody that is a student a spouse a parent and an employee all the same time somebody like that they're the poster child for role strain
 role strain I know I got it out of order I'm sorry role strain is too many expectations
 and that's an example of how that is you you're in a your ears moving from place to place I'm I'm now now I'm a teacher and now I'm a parent now I'm up employee now I'm an employer got to get in fire somebody today all that stuff creates stress and pressure and it's my spouse's birthday
 role ambiguity is defined as unclear unclear expectations and textbooks typically illustrate this and I think it's a very Captain illustration of the use of women who are in typically or previously male-dominated professions another word I got to talk to you about the women that were in my Seminary classroom classmates studying to be ordained ministers their world was a little bit ambiguous because they were in a clearly male-dominated profession and they brought into that male-dominated profession expectations of femininity
 because that's what women live with also true among the first and maybe still women in the military certainly women in Special Forces maybe women who are First Responders in law enforcement Etc bringing into a very masculine stereotypically historically environment the expectations associated with female that revolve around femininity
 I think it's also there's a level of role ambiguity just becoming a college student transitioning from high-school to college
 the rules are different the rules are different and you have to adjust and bring that in so there's a level of ambiguity that gets resolved after a while he gets resolved because you figured out and you you bring to bear your own value system on the ambiguity role conflict is greater than role strain if role strain is too many expectations real conflict are incompatible expectations incompatible expectations textbook simply textbooks typically site being a friend of Jew during the Holocaust or shielding or protecting someone who is your dear friend from Nazi occupation as it were you can't be both of those at the same time you got to go all in one of the other
 but I think it's a reasonably accessible example of this the role of friend friend of a friend right at least one lifelong best friend UPS the ante a little bit this is the person that give you while you play sports with is a kid that your families went on trips together at least picnics you snuck into hotel pools and went swimming you know that kind of thing
 let's imagine that you and that lifelong best friend have successfully lobbied and been recommended by your representative in Congress to attend Texas Tech University but to attend the US Military Academy at West Point you are cadets you are sworn members of the United States Army and you live by an honor code now Texas Tech has a code of student conduct if you are caught cheating on an exam or plagiarizing a paper there are penalties for that
 code of student conduct is what it is and a lot of students I think approach that at Texas Tech with the idea that if you're not cheating you're not trying to know and I noticed somebody in your class somewhere rubbernecking on a test using a crib sheet you know somebody plagiarized on a paper and I know anybody that ever done that most of you at least would be aware of that well if you're at West Point all of those rules are in place plus the honor code on honor code is what you swear to uphold and to live by and the code is not only I will not cheat
 the honor code includes I will not tolerate fraud by anybody else meaning the person sitting next to you using a crib sheet you are honor-bound to report that HonorBound and buy that if you fail to report it you have an honor code violation that was subject you not just a fun thing a test that was subject you from expulsion from West Point and call now will double the offer a dishonorable discharge from the United States Army that's how strongly they mean that
 and I don't go with you for life
 so let's imagine your lifelong best friend is using the crib sheet into West Point sociology exam who rats him out
 nobody maybe one sort of half-hearted like oh dang right
 put the very least at the end of that exam just tries to beat the living crap out of him for putting you in that position well that's what I mean those are incompatible expectations that is serious stuff
 all right
 ascribed status things were born with Chief status those we acquire by our activity master status the one thing that defines us Above All Else role ambiguity unclear expectations what are the rules here role strain too many role conflict incompatible expectations associated with what I am and what I do
 I got a crib sheet which everybody gets
 this is an example of a woman which is an ascribed status she is female she also has gender role expectations and we'll talk more about that but you get the idea femininity to as a researcher maybe she teaches maybe she teaches in the
 in the Pathology Department over at the Health Sciences Center so she has a laboratory roll she runs a lab she writes papers she is married so there's a nurturing and supporting set of expectations she teaches there's an instructional role in the classroom a collegial role with colleagues and fellow teachers and she raised his kids got a mom deal and you know works with the PTA
 that looks like kind of a complicated life doesn't it you can certainly see the role strain in play there but that's an example of one person that illustrates all of those concepts of ascribed and achieved statuses and role expectations and that's just a handout for for your learning
 turn off
 all right let me talk next about what I'm just going to introduce today something that I'm going to talk about him in great detail on Thursday that is social groups the title for Thursday's presentation through an organization so I'm going to introduce the idea what a social group is it's a number of people
 who share similar values
 norms
 role expectations
 are people that share you know the elements of culture values Norms role expectations regularly
 number of people who share values norms and role expectations and who get together they interact with one another as a group and have a group identity
 so let me ask you this two redheads qualify as a group
 probably not there a category but I don't know of a national redhead convention every year but the only one in the room then right
 members of the band where am I Goin band from raiderland members
 you get together now and then on purpose and the purposes for which groups get together fairly obvious fairly easy to list I mean why do we join groups We join groups so that we make friends
 we accomplish goals in like learn the new March step we fulfill our calling you know got a brand new PhD in sociology Department to fulfill what it is you've worked hard to do with group membership sometimes comes Prestige Phi Beta Kappa provide service is a reason to join groups and we'll delve into that more deeply on Thursday when we talk especially about what it means to be a part of the group and group dynamics for things like loyalty and Conformity come into play
 so that's what groups are
 finally I want to talk about like I said most of this segment was at the micro-level but I want to talk about a micro-level view of institution if you will that social institutions are in play in our interactionist structures and role expectations and Status sets all of them this is a little piece on self and Society again let's review what we mean by institution essentially family religion education
 government Healthcare economy family religion education and start of the values-driven institutions where we get our sense of purpose and meaning and come to believe
 a benefit government Healthcare economy's sort of serves our needs meets our interests and so on
 from the functionalist point of view
 the family has an impact on individuals the family as an institution is designed to you know to put it bluntly facilitate reproduction your people died people are born and successful societies have a balance between that the family structure the courtship cohabitation legal formation of family groups within the structure of the family
 facilitate reproduction we have people born to replace those we lose whose lives and works with families to provide training and instruction to individuals who can fit into the economy which provides goods and services
 to do so in ways that are conforming to government regulations you know comes down to simple things like the absolute law against telephones going off in class or wait a minute I was about to say prayer in public school
 there are institutional realities that play out in rooms and reproduction training and education playing by the rules fitting into an economy and one of the individuals decide you know he's probably had somebody say well what's your major when I get to do when you're done and that's not always an easy question to answer it's not always an easy question to answer consistently for 4 years
 I flunked an advanced chemistry final in the end at the end of my junior year and the adviser sort of put his arm around me and said this shall be a sign unto you that maybe medical school is now off the tape that's what it was
 wand of teaching in the med school though so I want in the end in any case
 what helps you decide what you want to do or what career you want to pursue what is it that you were born to do or that in a sort of philosophical way you need to do for the sake of the world what person is obviously Advanced quantitative analytical chemistry can you do need that is part of it was just a window looking back onto no 67 years of life
 and the decisions that I have made that have worked out and others that have not work out well at all in terms of my own role in the world how do you want to live
 how do you want to live if you want to live to work to make that your number one priority for you on a work so that you can live on your own terms
 how do you want to live is the most important question to answer when you're trying to figure out a major or why you want to apply for a job or whether you think that someone might be a significant other and so on how do I want to live in with whom those are the only questions that matter and it goes to a kind of identity issue but also a level of functionality on the macro-level there are ways in which you can figure that out you can go to a college you can explore our sector in the economy you can decide whether religion matters to you and pick and choose the institutional versions of that so far so good
 this is self and Society peace that produces an interlocking relationship between family education government Healthcare economy and so good
 a conflict view of social institutions through the lenses of social groups and identities is really pretty simple from the conflict point of view all of that functionality I just talked about and all of that solidarity individuals might experience when they connect with a a person to marry a job and so on all of that goes to things it reproduces inequality
 because power stays where it already is and the other way to get power redistributed from where it already is his fight that's What conflict theory is about or having facilitated in some other way so from a conflict point of view institutions reproduce social inequality particularly gender inequality particularly gender inequality
 and secondly from a conflict point of view social institutions sometimes legitimate oppression
 it's okay to denigrate abused bully or even kill some some kinds of people
 and I'm interesting Lee enough if you're sociologist religion
 religion still legitimate depression or legitimate discrimination to say the least
 against women among others same-sex women particularly or men just a couple of examples how from a conflict point of view institutions especially operating as sources of pressure and Conformity to individuals and groups can perpetuate inequality and legitimate oppression
 turn up
 okay if this was a church bulletin we've done the readings and said the prayers and had the sermon now we just have to get to the closing hymn
 the last piece and let the outline here's a little bit misleading this is an interactionist view of social institutions a micro take on what from a micro perspective are largely artificial Concepts like family religion education on Big Picture level
 the interactionist view of Institutions and there are many but the one I'm going to pick is ethnomethodology this is not a separate category ethnomethodology is the interactionist view of institutions
 and
 by way of introduction ethnomethodology is a word that means folk methods it's a way of studying individuals in their larger context if you study individuals from the standpoint of knowledge you can learn about the institutional Arrangements in their world
 2 points of departure if you are examining your world by interacting with people as a method a methodologist two assumptions one the interaction
 that you experience are infinitely more complex than you think there's more going on than you imagine
 and it secondly almost entirely subjective
 you can make of an interaction what you want
 by perceiving it in one way or another so from the methodological point of view interactions that tells you also that institutions
 are infinitely complex and objective
 go up and you don't see your parents let's say until breakfast the next morning which for you is like 11:30 okay kind of stumble down and all that and blah blah and yeah this Monday and conversation that you always have but next time you do that pretend for a minute that you're not in your family home interacting with parents pretend that you're in the bed and breakfast interacting with the people that own it
 good morning mrs. Johnson how are you my name is Sarah
 what's for breakfast maybe not with fake names exhaustively polite and formal
 what are they teaching you at that University of them College professors talking to you about
 just mess with the context a little bit
 or just you know the next time somebody asked you and innocuous question which you know the aunt hey how you feeling I'm fine thanks for asking instead of saying fine thanks for asking when somebody says how you feeling go I'm not sure do you mean I'm not using my fingers for tactile information-gathering
 no do you mean am I warm or cold no do you mean am I sick or well you know what I mean you dumbass yeah and what they mean
 but parse it out I don't know where this technology is going to work but I have I'm sorry The Big Bang Theory is going out of business I like the show is Sheldon Cooper is sort of the master of ethnomethodology of exhaustively clarifying his world right there's a little scene that occurs fairly early in the in the seasons of delegates in season 3 or something where he and Penny are having a conversation and they encounter each other in the Mailroom and Penny has recently broken up with Leonard that's the that's the backdrop so I'm going to see if I can get this to work
 thought I had this download it
 maybe not okay it's going to give me and it's going to take me an hour
 realtor having sex
 time out on the field
 try this again
 now we got to see if we get the sound work
 apparently not
 tell you what you can take a look at that probably on your own with the Machinery that actually works so we're just going to have to go go let that go enjoying this app no
 not just no but a g e double hockey sticks know there two versions is a WMV file it when you click on Windows media and there's an mov file on Apple so look at that Sheldon Cooper exhaust clarifying his world
 I'm giving you a handout on how to be your own armchair ethnomethodologist you can do two things you can do what are called breaching experiments that is you can breach conventional rules a little bit a little and get an idea of how important those rules are in the world or you can change the way you look at the world or maybe more accurately how others see you in your world by doing some fairly simple thing and I got a little worksheet
 these are ethnomethodological strategies how you can do some breaching experiment in the United States and I know a lot of you are not native us born citizen others are visiting with us others have become citizens over time we don't negotiate the price of things we basically say how much is it do I want it for that and make a decision other countries you can negotiate just about anything worth of Diet Coke please
 I want to do that because these days you're going to have to arithmetic you just have to push a button if you work at McDonald's and if there's no button for $0.64 worth of Diet Coke you can't do it cuz ice cream place in Lubbock not long ago that by definition an ice cream sundae was two scoops of ice cream and most of the time I didn't want two scoops of ice cream neither did my wife and throwing up there once early on in and then I kicked in my ethnomethodological expertise ice can you sell me one of one scoop sundae know why not because Sunday is button here and I have to buy suppose I could sell you a one scoop sundae but I would have to charge you for two scoops cuz that's what a sundae cost
 so I thought for just a second I thought wait a minute let's let's just mess around for a second you don't want me for your customer probably
 I said okay can I get a two-scoop sundae please yes could I get one of those scoops of ice cream vanilla and one of those scoops of ice cream chocolate yes cuz I like to know when my wife likes chocolate I said Can on one of those Scoops I get caramel topping with cashews that's my favorite yes no problem and on the other of those Scoops the chocolate one can I get marshmallow topping her favorite yes I smoke a one more question can you put those scoops of ice cream in separate cups
 Kinko's
 not even up chart I shut off I'll be happy to pay for one extra cup okay with that alright
 at the methodology
 what's next
 wear business suit class see what people do I will start seeing that people will come to class dressed quite well in business. Casual and their interviews right where your prom dress
 all the girls just went
 where to get a tuxedo you know if you're in a wedding on Monday before you take it back where the class just for fun
 cuz there are levels of convince these are breaching that you're breaching convention is all you're doing right down staircase that's not you know that's not necessarily a big deal 20 or so people in the class and think about that class for a second is there at least one person in the class that sort of the college version of the kid that goes take are you forgot to give us our homework right
 and every time every time
 questions Yakety Yak sits in the front row or someplace like that get there early sit where they sit
 watching do this and art to say Sheldon you're in my spot
 conventions
 go to an elevator you know I'm just get up and all you know be careful about that one to my point is they're all with every every so little bit my now retired colleague out Roberts with he was a methodologist on my research team and taught taught this in his social science research methods class he would send out his students to buy to you know like Noah and the Ark right
 go find a way to screw with your world a little bit and see what happens and he would tell me what is to come up with and they're very creative and rather olestra to the next title my two favorite he told me stories about student doing this for 20 years these are my two favorite examples of what students dreamed up to sort of test out the folk methods in their world one involve two guys both of which were of substantial size and one of which clearly and obviously a white guy and the other guy clearly and obviously Hispanic and they went into a Hispanic bar on the east side and
 the white guy was nearly native fluent in Spanish and so was the other guy but the other guy
 gave the impression that he wasn't such that the white guy was translating into Spanish a lot of what was going on. Order in Spanish for him and then translated into English so that pretty soon in the aura of the place the other folks in the bar I got the idea that there was a Spanish guy that didn't speak Spanish right then I don't know what the Spanish word for coconut is sort of brown on the outside and white on the inside that was what he was you know and you could you sing yourself yeah I can see how that happened
 my other one this was a male and female tan to a guy and a girl both went into a club around campus and the exact same question with the exact same word it just to see what would happen the guy asked him girls the girl asked 10 guys the question was you look interesting you look interesting to me would you like to spend the night at my place just out of the blue no Preamble that's what they did
 the girl got 10 yeses
 the guy got 10 nose
 one of the guys that said yes was heartbroken that it wasn't real my whole life I've been hoping that would happen
 but you can see you know this is just checking out people in the act of being themselves and we are to say the least entertaining right you might also just for fun change how others look at you may be looking at this PCS or just a couple of suggestions you don't buy your clothes at the thrift store go buy an outfit their fun and see what happens you know how do people see you differently when you try to negotiate the price of something grocery shop after midnight if you don't normally already do that and if you already generally grocery shop after midnight and you know you know what that subcultures like go to Market Street on a Saturday morning at ten whole different world is subjecting yourself to The Hazing and in some ways humiliating degradation ceremony for applying for public assistance you can do it online now take a look at what you have to do what you have to produce
 what regulations there are and what assumptions that seem to be coming through about you like prove to me you aren't a cheating varmint and never will be kind of stuff I'm not proud of this but this time of year actually maybe and maybe another couple weeks hands and my senior year when I ran out of money I do no work Summers and saving all this ran out of money and I knew that my income tax refund check was going to be there in about 2 or 3 weeks and that would carry me through for the rest of the semester but I was at this little Bridge. So I called home and I didn't ask my dad for money I told him I'd applied for food stamps
 and he sent me a hundred bucks
 Carmine's going to be on welfare and see what happens
 one last thing I want to explain to you how intriguing this can be with some level of a consequence one of the most famous ethnomethodological
 research efforts this isn't something entitled that counseling experiment experiment arrangement with someone who is professionally trained to help you work through problems that's a pretty powerful relationship there's also a lot of subjectivity that goes on with that counselors trying to read nonverbal cues you're trying to tell the truth within the limited range of what you feel comfortable with at any given moment your gauging you know how far can I go with this for real and still fine trust its epicenter of the methodology of psychology Professor named Harold garfinkel ran on the UCLA campus Johnson Twitter and they just said free therapy anybody wants to work out a problem contact our office will set you up no no charge and the therapist
 it looked exactly like a therapist office I mean they did they decked him out in couches and clocks and Kleenex boxes and all the deal right and the council he's were told that you can work out any problem ask any question but if you want feedback from the counselor
 if you want the counselor to talk to you you can talk about anything for as long as you want the couch will listen but if you want feedback frame it so that the question you asked can be answered yes or no relationship problems do you think I'm a good relationship yes you think I should break up with my boyfriend
 and they would get sometimes innocuous responses that were not logical why because the responses of counselors gate at nothing to do with the question that encounter unbeknownst to the council eat with a sheet of paper on the desk that had a list of yes as it knows just in line yes yes yes no yes no yes no no no yes yes chosen completely at random
 and whatever the question was asked they just gave the next answer on the list or no
 what was amazing about this is that two things they learned and they learned it quickly and repeatedly one I never got such direct information I finally was able to work out an issue to when the council he's got inconsistent information they did emotional handstands to make it to make it make sense to what may be the baby when he said I should break up with my boyfriend that was only if that that's only if things change etc etc so there's this whole resolution of the went through to make the authority figures advice seemed plausible and then at the end of the day was great
 intriguing you can run numbers like the sun people they call it commercial advertising they call it political speechifying etc etc etc
 questions
 going to take a lot of what I just did with with groups and even in some sense ethnomethodology and up the ante a little bit when we talked about group dynamics on Thursday especially related to royalty and conformity
 thanks a lot
