so Joe could you give us back on in your major discipline
 never really wanted to start doing computer science until like I just found myself coating a lot just randomly
 interesting so you know a lot about the technical software background side of a like the internet and programs yeah
 so are you concerned as an American that big brother or the American government is watching over us and recording us and using all this information without our permission and invading our privacy I'm definitely
 interesting do you think there's any positives that come out of this well I think the positive is that it reveals the where
 where the power comes from cuz when you look at civilization overtime the societies that
 really check their population in check where the ones that understood like the main message that the society needs so they Hitler key he deliberately spread propaganda and stuff now he has a little red book he spread propaganda is that way I think propaganda now is social media and web results that you get from talking to Google and the government controls those right now
 interesting okay so you're saying that weather and whether we like it or not there's the possibility that we're being so consciously control it like you said the technical aspect of things is beyond the average person right and not you know the average person doesn't understand how search algorithms work or how their data is being used against them they just know that it works it's the same way like
 do you know what I'm saying
 yes
 okay so in 2013 when Edward Snowden released all those files and met with three reporters in Hong Kong do you think that he is an American hero or a committed treason only time will tell but in my mind I think he's
 he is an American hero like eat when you think about like National nationalism like you think about support for your country but when you think about patriotism you think about like how American one person is in a lot of people call him not the Patriot or traitor but he's the exact definition of a patriot he doesn't have like a blind respect for the government she cares about what it means to be an American and America was founded off of like individual liberty and that you own everything that you create or all that stuff and Kiki did the most American thing like you got that out there that the government was spying on us and stuff
 very true
 yeah I think it's a little sketchy and a little scary that the government's doing such a thing in that like instantly will not occur he was being accused of treason but like the American citizens everyone was like one of these a hero but the government was like the big players in the government and if our government supposed to stand in the Bible what the people say I think I think you're right about or I think they were right because when you when you look at a lot of things like for most situations disclosing top-secret information like that gets people killed like when you when you
 Anvil like something that was meant not to be unveiled especially in the US government a lot of lives are depending on that but it seems that he went out of his way to minimize the amount of damage the information released but damage was still done the wannacry virus has a very recent problem it's basically ran somewhere that takes over Administration and computer buildings and they shut the entire thing down and force you to pay currency from that well with the documents that Snowden leaked he leads a lot of exploits in operating systems that were later used in ransomware attacks that we see today so a lot of what he did was had a good spirits but it did have negative effects on the society that he did not intend
 interesting see you this Saturday a double-edged sword certainly wouldn't have done it but I respect I think a lot of people stand on that but thanks Joe
 thank you for having me on your podcast
