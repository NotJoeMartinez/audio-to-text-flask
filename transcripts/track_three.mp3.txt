this is my buddy I can't disclose his name due to certain reasons he is well known within a community and he has a lot of respect because of some of the things he's done and he actually has a contract with the government stating he will not
 do work for anyone else and will not tamper with anything because of some of the things he has done so here's his expert opinion
 so
 do you believe that we have complete privacy on the on the internet at all
 why is that we've never have privacy on the internet we have enough privacy since the fifties since the last time first time someone is plugged into the internet and automatically typed in the password and username every single packet of data is able to be accessed by anyone it just depends on how good the level is of accessing data so you can disclose a person's name location age just by just by following their data for a few minutes or hours you can tell if it's family computer if someone is using multiple different usernames and passwords login into certain sites like School management like learning management databases and stuff or if they're working for government
 are anything like that you can literally find everything about them just by Falling on per day or so
 are you sure you wasn't even got aware that you can go back to eat with it because and I'm like I mean that's part of my major is being able to do stuff like that and just everything's like. But I honestly wasn't aware that you did take someone's whole personality and who they are just from following the footsteps of calling the pot correctly
 so
 that kind of reminds me that in 2013 we all know that Edward Snowden released secret document files that their government was watching us in tracking our data even though we're American citizens and we're clearly not going to do anything wrong he said that this protocol had been going on since 9/11 and it's not even concerned just with people that are coming into the country but with everyone
 do you consider him a hero or did believe he actually committed treason
 I've been mixed opinion on Snowden since he released all of the documents with his name tied to its that like yes he would be the scapegoat of like whatever Fallout happened but he also wanted the fame from being the person to release all of this information so he's sort of fall
 I don't like him for multiple reasons mainly because he used government property to steal govern property which in itself is just doing one bad thing for like most important things
 yeah he was trying to balance out something really good just by doing something really bad so I don't like that he should have just carried at a slow leave like part by part out instead of just trying to take everything at once. But there's a very kind of conspiracy conspiracy theory out there regarding snowed in and saying that
 the government planning this whole situation such that they could get an Insider
 in the Russia that would be able to leak stuff back to them secretly and although it just goes a lot about the government's security and what they were doing to us
 do you think it would you think there's a possibility that this was kind of a planted idea
 no not at all
 like there's no way that he would do that mainly because the government has very strict rules on what they can do with people who have committed treason and if you can't like you can't do anything any work with them after you've committed treason, you're essentially like it's not that your slave it's just that like you're all like the rule book on how to treat you is thrown out the window as soon as you've done something that lets enemies of the nation go and have an advantage against us so
 like they would not have used him as a pawn like that because it would have given him power against us like more power than he at had at the time because you could have just walked out of like wherever she was and just lost contact with his Handler if he does have a Handler like this is not this is not an involuntary think he did this voluntarily
 okay
 I think that's all I needed to know thank you for time
