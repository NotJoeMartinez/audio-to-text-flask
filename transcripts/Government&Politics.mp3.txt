good morning
 okay first things first what did the left eye say to the right eye
 the left eye said to the right eye you know something between us really smells
 fair enough
 music you've been listening to is three songs by a group called The Flatlanders and they are a Lubbock group that go back to the late sixties early seventies and I are just social commentators about life in West Texas observational poignant music really the middle song has a line in it that I think in one sentence summarizes today's lecture on politics and that is the line is it's the
 how does this go hold on a second
 it's the Fearless who loved and the Loveless who fear I think that's an elegant turn of phrase Fearless who love in the Loveless who fear
 details
 this is the second of three presentations in the interest based social institutions segment of the class and the next exam exam 5 is a week from today so there's this presentation on politics and Thursdays presentation on the economy coupled with the last week's on Healthcare and test test 5 maybe the last one you take because you will wind up being able to drop the final so the question is how do I know this well I did a little Riff on this at the start of class Thursday and I will do it for the next two segments as well just so everybody knows
 your greatest percentage of a point total perfect score in this class is 270 points that's 50 points each on five exams and Four Points each on five Greg Abbott 27250 + 20
 90% of that is 243 so that's the that's the target for earning an A in the class so you may have 243 points after test 5 in which case you have earned the A and nothing can take it away from you while then the question is do I have to come to class the last three class. Of course the answer to that is the same as it's been all semester you never have to come to class that's free country in your adults you know how you decide in some ways you know ask yourself how much you want to learn but you know it's really up to you as it is always really up to you now there is one more Abbott day to be to be done it'll be today it'll be Thursday or to be one of the last three class periods and so you just keep that in mind there's another Abbott day out there and that's four points and that you know me well make the difference between needing to or being able to take the final or not
 but let me give you a couple hypotheticals let's imagine that after Tuesday's test you have 239 points hypothetically okay that's four point short of 243 well if there's an Abbott they left to get just show up to class and you'll get it 243 borders board you can't not earning a once you earn 243 236 points that would be seven point short at 2:43 so assume the last Abbot day that takes you to 2:40 which means you're three-point short of an a everybody with me so far
 and of course it goes with any of the cut-offs but let's imagine everybody's at worst 3-point shorter than a in the class so you take the final and in order to move up and earn the egg you have to earn on the final exam three points more than your previous lowest test another word you want to replace that lowest test with one that's at least three points better that makes it so if you have a 240 total and your lowest test score is 40 what do you need on the final
 Muni 43 that makes sense that's a fairly typical situation for folks who can move up by taking the file well that's that's the second pasta with first possibility as you earn that you've earned a grade that you want the a if you will without taking the final that's fine then you're done you the second possibility is that you can earn the grade you want by taking the final and I just described how that works third possibility is you may not have the grade you want but taking the final won't help there aren't enough points available in order for you to move out but imagine you have 220 points with the Abbot and so on the lowest possible B I think is 219 so in order to go from 220 to 240 3 you have to beat your lowest test score by 23 points
 and let's say your lowest test scores of is a 35 there are 23 points available is only 50 points on the final you can only beat your lowest score by 15 in that is so taking the final won't help so there's no need to take it then you can't lose anything that you've already got them by not taking final exam so one of three things you will know things after Tuesday and assuming the hypothetical that you'll get the last for Abbott points if they haven't already been available fair enough you either have
 you have the grade you don't want in the final can't help or the final can help and it will help by having your performance on the final be the same number of points better than your lowest test score you need to get better than 3 on the final you need to get three points better than your previous lowest score clear about that are there questions in anybody's mind about that way of figuring things out
 but I dreamed up this scheme I thought this is simple and yet students still find it confusing because they're more used to trying to figure out an average and you can do that you know just take all of the points you have been divided into the points that are available to that point in the in the in the chorus and you can figure out your average but that doesn't matter the grades are calculated based on the number of points
 so it's a really it's just like a bowling score not everything you knock down as an answer to a question or if you're here for an Abbott day you picked up the 7-10 split
 okay the second of three presentations on interest-based social institutions today politics and government distinguish between two words that are often confused and many believe mean the same thing power and authority now the way I want to distinguish them gives me an opportunity to talk about government which is a source of authority
 how are we I usually think of power in kind of an individual sensor things in my life that Empower me I've become a practice speaker and I can sell in the economy my ability to talk that's really the only skill I have but I figured out how to sell it so that's an empowering thing to be able to set it set the goal of of grabbing that that undergraduate degree and you are able to achieve it because you have worked hard in high school your intellect that you were born with resources your parents have had grit determination all of those things enable you to be empowered to wind up with you know in Fairly short order
 the accomplishment to go use that you're sitting here because you wish now you don't wish you are working toward an achievable goal that is empowering of Power Authority is the ability to coerce compliance other words to get people to do things that they'd rather not do
 and government has Authority you know I know the most authoritative thing I think government does is
 enforce their will on us to pay taxes and most people don't want to do that I would rather not pay any taxes and I would say okay that's fair in a democracy we have elected leaders who we have freely chosen to set tax rates and so on but let's think about it another way
 when we pay money into a tax pool whether it's property tax or sales tax or income tax or whatever it is the money that we provide to state federal and local governments is used to buy things that all of us use
 now whether that's done efficiently or wisely or in our best interest is an open question and we have elections every once in awhile where you get to pitch in and adjudicate whether they're doing the job that you want them to do fair enough here's my point lower taxes do not necessarily mean lower Quality of Life OK Condo Association and that we also sort of shared governance and all that and seven years ago a lawn caught fire between two condoms and damaged severely two adjacent basement walls we're lucky that we live six blocks from the firehouse and all of us pay taxes to the city that then uses that money to build and maintain firehouses fire trucks hire firefighters and so on our tax money was well-used that day when Engine 9 came and put the fire out and we survived Plan B would be for all of us to pitch in
 say we're going to buy a fire truck and hire Five Guys to sit on it in front of the condo association in case we have another fire they'll be there quicker which is the most cost-effective way of dealing with the threat of fire obviously pay some taxes
 is a pool resource and at least in our democracy which will talk about in a minute the the process by which in the amount of money we pay in taxes even though we don't like it necessarily I mean I look at my by pay stub and I wind up taking home about 60% of what tech pay is not like those a lot of different places including the rec center and a charitable contribution lots of other things health insurance for my wife and so on but that's a fair bite out of you know what we are going to goes into a pool that gets us other things and those fools are managed by authority figures they are in a sense of working on our behalf and our only recourse is to change the people in the in the that have the authority authority rests in the offices that people hold I might add
 all right all I have by way of introduction to distinguish between power which is sort of in this instance or for this lecture anyway an individual characteristic that all of us seek to Bill go to set a goal and achieve it as opposed to Authority in a sense the ability to coerce or negotiate compliance let's put it that way so sorry about the different kinds of authority that tend to work in tandem with different types of government traditional Authority by custom or inheritance you inherit the authority from the one to whom you were born or it is customary in the culture that certain categories of people have authority they have coercive or negotiable compliance Authority in our culture it is eminently function
 we talked about this with family and the last segment parental Authority is an example of traditional Authority
 when the custody arrangements for children are adjudicated birth parents have an extra tip at the table in some sense if someone wants to remove the custody of a child from a birth parent there has to be substantial reason for that there's this Authority that's assumed through parentage that's one example the other is Authority that comes from your being the the child and next in line to the throne in a monarchy so we'll talk about that again it's something you inherit if you are a part of a royal family
 rational-legal Authority is Authority conferred by law and in the representative democracy you and I live in the authority of those who govern is in this category of rational-legal authority by the way this is Max Weber skiing in his discussion of of the state
 it's a rational legal Authority is already conferred by the Constitution that outlines the separation of powers legislative executive and judicial judicial branches of government and an entire legal system devised and developed to preserve protect and defend that that form of rational legal Authority may be the opposite of rational legal Authority charismatic Authority by a particular individuals exceptional personal appeal or charisma
 no many elected leaders
 make themselves electable by substantial levels of Charisma or personal appeal and some maintain leadership in that way for at least as long as they let Martin Luther King is a good example of a charismatic leader someone who in assets galvanized the effort to invoke civil rights and then to create major social change it off Hitler is an example of a charismatic leader who became the dictator of estate seized control of government through Power and force would say that. Donald Trump is a very successful charismatic leader in that his appeal to a particular segment of the country and I listed an optional article it just was published the last year who are the Trump electorate and I listed it is optional because I'm not going to ask a test question about it but it's a fascinating
 standing of how President Trump's Charisma appealed to a portion of the electorate and how that wound up putting him in office now here's the thing charismatic leadership is the most unstable of all forms of authority it's the one that is most likely to be to fail in it over time
 to put it bluntly a charismatic leader can lead with his or her Charisma only as long as they're alive
 the charismatic leader who wishes to institutionalize his or her Authority
 has to rally the troops and gather others around that agenda and embedded into the culture and this is just me standing back and analyzing things this is the difficulty that Donald Trump has had over the last three years is institutionalizing his Charisma that is getting people around him that that are able to manage his personality in some sense and to embed it into policy decisions there's a difference between being the CEO of a corporation that you own and you can literally say what I say goes and holding the office of an elected leader there's a difference between being an office holder and an office owner and I think that's the difficulty that that he personally I think it's having and that the people around him or have
 trying to sort it in bed what he is successful at doing and being into a process that successfully implement the policies that that got him elected
 what's connect these types of authority to types of government a monarchy is a form of government headed by a single member of a royal family a monarchy is government headed by a single member of a royal family Her Majesty his majesty there are
 there are functional monarchies and their ceremonial monarchies on planet Earth I think that Saudi Arabia the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a as a function of monarchy the house of Saud the royal family governs that Kingdom
 the United Kingdom led by her majesty Queen Elizabeth II has been in that role for a very long time is somewhat of a ceremonial monarchy
 she has consulted and signs decrees but primarily decrees that were embedded into law by Parliament the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the the functional head of the Democracy that is also a monarchy in the United Kingdom is the British prime minister at the moment so he is in affect the head of state but her majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the is the monarch in the car so the UK is a type of government that is Monarca go in name but a representative democracy in practice so we'll get to that in a little bit and you'll see how that that fits together
 an oligarchy is a form of government where a few individuals rule this is a type of government that usually shows up in the transition between sometimes a dictatorship in a democracy the overthrow of a government perhaps even an unjust government by force generates a temporary All Ark oligarchy where members of the military tend to rule in in for a short. Of time and then another form of government merges or at least another leader emerges how we see this from time to time there was an effort to unseat the Turkish president erdogan three or four years ago and that didn't work the oligarchy was not able to seize power a bunch of guys rule you know and the way I like to illustrate this is a much more micro and just a little story that I hold in my head that illustrates
 I call it the bunch of guys rule but I learned that from a guy who was the vice president of the swim team Parents Club at the YMCA where I work just right out of college sports team parents clubs are entertaining to say the least anyway for the Northern District of Indiana at the time I was living in South Bend the president of the group was shown to be a thief A thieving scumbag he was skimming money off the spaghetti dinner proceeds from the swim team that we're going to be used to buy a new sweats how low do you have to be to steal money from kids spaghetti supper money right
 and I said you're the federal prosecutor what are we going to do he said well we could arrest him and then all that and it would be a mess he said I think we should invoke the bunch of guys rule
 he was being facetious
 but that's what it is essentially bunch of guys go beat the hell out of the guy and take over and again these types of governments tend to be transitional they tend to be the result of a military overthrow which leads me to I think Vapors key inside about government in general and if it's in in this instance cuz it's especially olestra tip of it
 a successful Governor or president or anybody else
 has to be able to institutionalize the authority over what Weber called the means of violence the means of vinyl it is the state or that's vaper's term for government it's the state's primary responsibility to hold a thority over the means of violence and by that we met you sent to me law enforcement military and then negotiable about the availability of the means of violence with regard to personal weapons and so on so there's a process by which the government is most in Vapors view most prominently charged with controlling the means of violence and that's how all these come into play essentially if you are the president or the king or the premier or the Prime Minister you only stay in office as long as you have control the military the military can come in and throw you out I mean literally throw you out of the palace throw you out of the of the of the state house and so on
 are usually takes over so it's the issue for Weber in all forms of government is the rational control of the means of violence
 which brings me to two other forms of government a dictator's can successfully control the means of Violence by just paying the Army more than they pay everybody else you know what you can buy loyalty of the military a dictatorship is a form of government headed by a tyrant and ruled by force ruled by the control of the means of violence as it were
 which of course only last as long as your control the military
 obvious examples of the Third Reich with Hitler of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia during the 1970s and any other countries are ruled to varying levels of I guess intensity by a dictatorial process as it work and I think countries like turkey and Russia and China and other places there's a there's a democratic process but it seems to be tilted in some way by a dictatorial leader that sort of has most instances his thumb on the scale a little bit get the idea
 and the opposite of all of this is a representative democracy which is the root word of democracy is a Greek word that means rule of the people we elect in a free and open electoral process people who represent us and collectively work what is in all of our best interests now that's a debatable question and that debate gets adjudicated every two four or six years depending on which office on hold with the first 10 Amendments of the Bill of Rights and you get the email Free Press freedom for freedom of religion freedom of expression and all of the other freedoms that go with the US democracy or outline of the Bill of Rights and you should read them
 what is the most important piece on distinguishing a democracy from other types of governments and other forms of authoritative leadership is that the authority rests in the office not the person and again I think this is where Donald Trump the person is having a little trouble getting his head around the idea that his authority rests in the office he occupies which is as the head of the executive branch of government that works in tandem with the legislative and judicial not just I'm the president or I'm the CEO I think that the distinction there is not as clear in the way he seems to operate I think that's what gets him into trouble
 be that as it may this is an assessment of how what we are is working and how there can be tension in the process if some of these things are not understood by everybody involved
 what's the name of that TV show designated Survivor have you heard that that is such a that put into our culture what I have always thought you know there always is an anytime every representative in government is in the same building notably the State of the Union Address every year every year all of our leaders are essentially one place and in a sense very vulnerable to a catastrophic attack well by Lottery one member of the cabinet doesn't get to go to the state of the union meeting or say the Union Address and other events like this I guess he or she could sell the tickets on eBay that would work but they're in a spirited either Spirited Away in an undisclosed location in the very unlikely and extraordinarily catastrophic event that every other person in our government is killed we still have someone to occupy the office
 the office is what needs to be preserved more than the person in it in this is why interesting ly enough to the Office of the President is the only one in our representative democracy that has a term limit we insist and have insisted only since the forties that the person I'm the person occupying that office can only occupy for X number of years technically they could top that could occupy that office for 8 years to two elected terms and then if they were the vice president and took over on the first day of the president's term they couldn't affect occupied the office for 11 years are in 64 days that's the limit and the only way that would work is if they were the vice president and the president left office for some reason on the first day and that person became President Lincoln was elected twice more so basically it's an eight-year term limit get the idea
 that is the rationality behind the law that limits the term of time that a an elected representative holding an office can can have that Authority that make sense by custom
 rational-legal authority authority conferred by law charismatic authority authority converted by karisma or exceptional appeal monarchies form of government headed by the single member of the royal family oligarchy a coalition of leaders a bunch of guys dictatorship rule of tyrannical rule by by force of a dictator and democracy essentially ruled the people with the authority resting in the office questions
 what's a government supposed to do well for essential things to create not just functionality of government but also Partnerships with other social institutions enforcement of norms law enforcement we have rules we have bodies or collections of people police forces and so on Military to enforce those rules those rules are negotiable I mean the laws are a part of the judicial process and law enforcement is done on the streets if you will by men and women who are First Responders but also in court you know I had an interesting experience the last time I was called for jury duty and most of the time when I've been called I'll even get up I'll text her or it'll be on the news and become the last time I had to go
 and there you know two or three hundred people in the room and I select by random La a pool of about 60 people and if your number is up and they still like you that means you just basically have to spend the day because you wind up going into the court house or into the courtroom and you are sort of questioned as a group and sometimes individually over whether or not both the prosecutor and defense attorney can agree that you would be one of the 12 to sit essentially in judgment to be one of the jury of the defendant Spears
 and I you know it's
 it's really annoying to have to do this and if you ever get called for jury do Ace to joke around in my class just tell him you took sociology and you can tell someone you guilty just by looking at them and then they won a Pulitzer nevermind don't do that
 raising shouldn't do it is this and this is happen to me for 5 times but the last time it happened to judge just looked at all of us before we did anything else and the judge said I know this is no fun you are spending an entire day doing very little except sitting there and he said I want to thank you for that and then he said I want to tell you one more thing
 he said without you we have no democracy
 without you we have no democracy and I thought that was very wise very apt and I thought okay I can suck it up for one day right I ain't get called and I left and that was the end of that but I mean that's literally what distinguishes the u.s. judicial system the US enforcement of norms process from pretty much any other any other type there are other places obviously that have jurors but the jury pool is really the Cornerstone of law enforcement which is the Cornerstone of our democracy and I thought that was very wise and very apt next time you get a jury summons roll your eyes go through the hassle of making of clearing your day and then walk in there probably is really the carrier of really the essence of what we are collectively
 planning and direction this is refers to infrastructure roads buildings tunnels regulations building codes in a you can't just build a house you have to hire somebody that is certified to
 demonstrate that they have built it as Welling that's up to code
 this varies from place to place who comes from one of the major metroplexes Dallas-Fort Worth San Antonio Austin Houston that kind of thing
 very complex infrastructure just replacing or adding a porch onto your house cause is a lot of hassle making sure it's up to code who comes from a town of what's a less than 2000
 if 3000 something like that how many of you would say that you could close your eyes and envision a place in your small town we're on the same block there would be a split-level Ranch 4 bedroom home maybe a duplex or an apartment complex and even a double-wide sort of in the same general area that makes
 that's because small towns do less with respect to something like zoning the zoning laws in larger municipalities are my example of planning and Direction it is not legal to put a commercial Enterprise in a single-family dwelling neighborhood in Lubbock Texas where I think this is most relevant for Tech students is the area immediately south of the campus the tech Terrace area that is zoned R-1 residential single-family dwelling every once in awhile a house will be sold to someone who buys it for his or her
 son or daughter to live in while attack and then they're like six roommates it come in and you have an affect a frat house in Tech Terrace that doesn't happen very often because it's not legal and it's not legal for more than two unrelated people to live in the same dwelling in a single-family neighborhood
 and related meaning by Blood marriage or adoption and so on more than two unrelated people violates the zoning code in a single-family dwelling in a lot of times it only happens if the people who are there illegally in a scent violate the privilege by being noisy and Rowdy and destructive and all that and that's especially that's an especially Vivid example of planning and direction in college towns the zoning board holds quite a bit of power and it requires a special permits to that shopping center that's on 25th and Boston where the coffee pot shop is in his grocery store across the street that that takes a special variance to be set into the middle of that of that residential neighborhood of course it's in everybody's interest to have some commercial availability in residential areas Etc
 planning and directions of government does that
 arbitrating conflicting interests I just talked about the court system know the court system and enforcement of norms and arbitrating conflicting interests essentially is the job of law enforcement and the courts
 and also Protection Law Enforcement is the government probably the the governmental figure that we are most likely to encounter is a police officer remember the military because that's sort of what produces the base level functionality for government and culture all of these four things
 this looks like it's going to be pretty short but there's a extended roof hear from a conflict point of you want to talk about two things I'm going to do fine the power elite fairly quickly and then I'm going to talk about how all of these functionalities
 before seminars planning and Direction arbitrating interest in protection all of those innocence reproduce social inequality
 that's the title of another book its title of a book that was written by C Wright Mills who I talk to you on the second day of class is the author of the sociological imagination C Wright Mills also a book called the power elite and you know any sort of 25 words or at least 5 minutes or less the main point of the book is that we may talk about and you may learn about in Sociology class that we have a representative democracy but at least according to Mills conflict driven theory on the power elite he said that is an illusion what we really have is an oligarch they constructed kind of a triangle have an oligarchy
 politics
 business and Military that the military angle of government took the enforcement part the political angle of government the representatives that we have elected and also the economy big business form a kind of Unholy Trinity
 business government
 business politics and military form to sort of Unholy Trinity that really control things now
 there are lots of examples of that the most Vivid in relatively recent memory I think can be conceptualized in the person of former Vice President Dick Cheney someone who you can look up he was Vice President George W bush before he was the CEO of The Halliburton corporation that was among the leaders and getting government contracts to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq and the question becomes how did that work well maybe it had something to them being vice president you know there's a whiff of that in the hunter Biden story you know that there's an Unholy alliance between politics business and government that is certainly at the heart of most of what is driving what's now known as the impeachment inquiry the alliance between government military business and other
 governments if you will you heard the phrase repeatedly and over the last three years about Russian oligarchs in play here these are just examples of what Mills called the power elite that in his View and admittedly is you know over toward the wall and conflict theory becomes a kind of Shadow government you know the alliance between business politics and Military and you also see the the the work of Rudy Giuliani right now I think is sort of on point here this is a way of I think conceptualizing what Mills was trying to talk about and all of these examples are just on a list of things that are in perfect but go together to give you an illustration of what Mills was talking about
 more I think more day today is would be the idea that you know we all know where the safe neighborhoods are and maybe protection is equally distributed for reasons that if you're up pretty militant conflict theorist might have to do with you know who are the rich people are the people that are worth saving where are they in an argument
 the whole issue of black lives matter among other things and the tense relationship that occurs or at least maybe is revealed when an officer-involved shooting happens and it happens to be another African-American male and so on that whole discussion would be coming out of a conflict perspective analyzing the extent to which protection as a function of government is equally distributed that's simply an illustration of the point
 1/4 meter protection planning and Direction and arbitrating interests I think it is almost inarguable using Jeffrey reiman the rich get richer and the poor get prison theory that having an attorney that you are able to pay yourself
 get you a better outcome probably it raises the probability that you'll have a better outcome in court relying on the public defender's office or a court appointed attorney is a way of getting representation and it is vital that that happened it's constitutionally mandated but if you can buy your own lawyer you've got a better chance of getting a better outcome and that's an example of how arbitrating interests it's not a Level Playing Field
 are the example I like to use in this goes on for just a little bit is the issue of planning and Direction and Zoning codes can be used to preserve the status quo sometimes to the detriment of a disenfranchised minority little personal stories from a conflict point of view
 infrastructure can be a resource that sun equally distributed brand new pastor in a small town of 25,000 that's me Macomb Illinois it's a part of Illinois called for Tony at which means if it's not Chicago forget about it. It's just it's in the west central part of the state any way affiliated with denomination that the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in the ELCA I was the only with that and it had a institution in Nebraska for the developmentally disabled this is in the early 80s when the whole issue of how to effectively
 Empower and enable the life chances of the mentally retarded the developmentally disabled how's that work and the ELCA owned an institution tell Nebraska that was doing this very well they had three or four hundred residents in a kind of institution that cared for you no wounded and damaged people development well that was kind of a social movement working there that maybe that isn't the best place to advance their well-being
 in at least in the least restrictive way I'm in an institution for the mentally retarded and I'm using that word just to illustrate what I'm talking about looks a lot like a prison you know not necessarily with barbed wire but I mean you know it's a lockdown kind of place and maybe it's for at least some there's a better way will the group home concept started to come in to vote and the organization that owned the institution in Nebraska got a bequest and came true Macomb Illinois because that's where the request came from and said we want to open a group home 6 developmentally disabled adults in a couple house parents in a group home in a residential area okay well that's going to require
 practically it fits the definition of family house parents six kids you need a big house
 unfortunately in that particular town the big player in town is it would that was then and still is Western Illinois University 10,000 of the 25000 Residence at the time in the whole town where
 what what amount to group homes for Tech 4244 W student and I thought we were we were trying to put up a prison in a residential area it took three years to really
 sort of absorb the rather cruel and negative energy and City Council meetings I was going to City Council meetings to advocate for this pretty regularly and people that and it's not a very big town so you kind of knew most everybody and people that I liked and cared about and prayed with them in the hospital we're suddenly saying things that I thought were weird it where is this coming from
 to overstated and put it bluntly but the general argument against this was and again I'm overstating it and putting it bluntly but I want you to catch the spirit of where it was in the room you put them retards in our neighborhood they're going to be raping are girls what what what what that's the fear that's the fear
 it turns out if your sociologist you can actually you can actually find data on this if a developmentally disabled person is involved in a sexual assault they are virtually always the victim not the perpetrator because they are they are people who can't fight very well and who are extraordinary vulnerable and they need protection and maybe we can protect them better in neighborhoods as it work again I took three years and a lot of compromise and what were the group home the group of had to be built from the ground up because they couldn't find a house in Macomb Illinois that methadone and criteria that were set forth for Groupon they put a special category in the zoning code for group homes it had to have X number of bedrooms and it had to have in this was the key a 50 foot setback on all sides so in other words from the house it had to be a 50 ft
 this way this way this way in this way it's in the middle of what amounted to a you know a hundred by 100 foot lot
 so you can spot the group home in Macomb Illinois it's the one with the really big yard and the cool fire escape looks like a deck off the back
 it took that and I'm way more expensive also interesting enough somewhat more isolating you know so there was a group home in Lubbock run by the same outfit I don't know if it still exists but we've we've moved from there but there's been a social movement in the deinstitutionalization developmentally disabled that illustrates a conflict point of view how planning and Direction can work against disenfranchised minorities that's my point fair enough
 from a conflict point of view the power elite and the extent to which functionality also reproduces inequality now that's a refrain that goes back to almost the first day of class questions so far
 I let me talk briefly about three things just us politics
 as it work micro-level thing it's a creation of a political identity
 we just asked you how many of you would say that you are very clearly aware of of the the red type of politics are blue type of politics that characterizes your your your home where your parents live okay would say that you are of a similar ilk that you are of the same okay whatever it Whatever It Is
 I knew that I was not I knew that I was a republican the same moment I knew that I was not a Catholic
 because I came home and I said that can wheelie Catholic now
 and then I said are we for Nixon orloj this was 1960 and I'm 6 years old and Richard Nixon is running for president against John Kennedy and I wanted to know the dumb question because large was Henry Cabot Lodge was running is Richard Nixon's running mate so my mother said we're for both of them that's what we not for wasn't quite this bad that kind of thing so I knew what I was and and interesting enough the first president ever voted for When I Was Eighteen was Richard Nixon in the 1972 election and we sort of develop an identity that goes along with all of the other identities that we get from home and then you know we get to college and we start rethinking reshaping or establishing an identity that becomes our own that may be quite similar
 or it may start to diverge
 who would say that when you go home for Thanksgiving dinner you yourself you hope that politics doesn't come up at the table
 you get the idea this can cause a level of tension and dissension in rooms as we interact lot of of of social psychologist would persuasively argue that you know the tension surrounding that question oh my gosh is politics going to come up is a little more intense you know as of late so that's all I mean by political participation is the result of truly of the sort of individual sense of what's in it for me what will happen to me if the person I vote for is elected and there are a lot of Elections
 where the answer is it doesn't matter who I vote for nothing will change in a local elections for railroad commissioner and stuff like that now I think that the challenge for anyone running for high office whether it be the presidency or in an off presidential year running for the senate or the House of Representatives is to convince enough people that it's worth their while to vote the election turnout in most major elections even the presidential election is right around or often beneath 50% or more in most major elections
 if they're voting with their feet say none of the above or maybe saying in a different way it really won't affect me one way or the other
 and then the question becomes what is what are the selling points from either party to get the vote out not just to get the vote out in general but to get the vote out of the people most likely to vote for the ones that are running so by and large voter participation is interest-based what's in it for me you know and I think that I think that a lot of I mean I made a distinction between value and interest based social institutions a lot there was a probably appalled by his personal behavior that their own values are not consistent with who he is or who he continues to claim to be but it is in their interest to vote for someone who represents what he stands for interest-based calculation is a part of what of what really became for most of us is surprising outcome of the 2016 election I don't think even Donald Trump
 but I think that there was a a calculation of values and interests that were in play in that in that process and we'll see what happens the next time around I really think that ultimately the US electorate the people of the United States will decide whether or not President Trump has committed any impeachable offense and they won't do it in the car if they'll do it The Ballot Box and that's how it should be and I think that the next step in whatever happens to a trump presidency should be decided altimate Lee and likely will at The Ballot Box and that I think is refreshing to know
 I think I didn't had no idea was going to take rest this far into the future I think of resolution came out of House of Representatives and then we'll have an election and we'll see what happens next and I think that that's probably how it should be ultimately whether we need the drama of the impeachment resolution in the acquittal the Senate open maybe we'll learn something maybe we want but I think that's probably what'll happen next and I think ultimately that to me is somewhat comforting that that ultimately the referendum on the Trump presidency for all it is or isn't will be decided at The Ballot Box and then the rest of us who may or may not like the outcome you know one way or the other probably got another four years we get to do it again
 and it's great to be an American I think it's lots and lots of ways

 all right questions or comments
 I was asking myself this morning where you going to go with this in light of current and in light of God bless and that's why I decided I would go but I sort of decided that on the Fly
 I have raised the issue of politics and religion before
 I've called your attention something that researchers called the Protestant establishment
 and this refers to the religious
 backgrounds of essentially the founding fathers and the story in a nutshell is that
 individuals who have occupied the presidency the president's cabinet and the Supreme Court throughout US History have been disproportionately members themselves of the Protestant establishment there either Episcopalian Presbyterian or originally congregationalists in the Congregational Church has now become the United Church of Christ and now that's very different than the Church of Christ Candlelight tradition that a lot of you are familiar with the United Church of Christ the Neo congregationalists are among the most Progressive denominations in the US they were among the first to ordain gay and lesbian clergy for example
 tell those three are known as the price establishment they collectively occupy less than 2% of the US population but they are there their adherence
 has occupied the presidency about half the time and the Supreme Court in the president's cabinet between a third and a half of the of u.s. History Sol and who's who in America the Forbes 400 all of this stuff the Protestant establishes disproportionately represented it represented in seats of power have a research article that I want to call your attention to and it's got some interesting charts
 this is the
 social class religion and Presidential appointments written by
 though this was one of those that they told me that I couldn't copy I don't know if we're going to get this the library supposedly put up a link to this
 and it obviously is not working they wouldn't let me buy copyright put this particular article in here so they said will provide you a link and because I was late to the office this morning I didn't double-check the link it so wait a minute maybe we're going to get it
 there we go
 just took a while
 okay Presidential appointments and religious stratification written by my teacher Jim Davidson and two people at the time we were his graduate student so this will tell you that not only is James C Davidson whip-smart and astute he's a Kind and Generous Mentor by putting two of his graduate students on this paper affiliations of Presidents by. And we're talking about the Protestant establishment Episcopalian Christian congregational other really Justice look across the top
 the top light in US history going up to 2003 was when this article was written there have been two presidents since 2003 Barack Obama in 2008 Donald Trump in 2016 let me tell you both of them are members of the Protestant establishment President Obama is a member of the United Church of Christ congregation Chicago President Trump is Presbyterian so this percentage past 2003 is actually higher so the process of establishment post the publication of this article is actually more pronounced spare enough we just need to know that this has changed some since 2003 when the article came out but it's change in the direction that Davidson was arguing so u.s. presidents 33 47% of all US presidents now more like 49% of u.s. Presidents since two more and I'm in the process of establishment
 religious affiliation of cabinet officers 45% in history and from the 1930s to the present members of the Protestant establishment that remains status quo let's talk about cabinet officers for a minute and let me introduce and I will know I'm sorry about that I want to move to one more charge to go to the next point the similar pattern is religious affiliation of Supreme Court Justices 50% of all members of the Supreme Court are members of privacy established and I I do not know the affiliation of the other most recently appointed under the Trump Administration Gorsuch is it not
 look up the representation on the Supreme Court but let me tell you where Davidson goes with this
 we have had non Protestant establishment members in the presidency in the Supreme Court and in the cabinet and Davidson's argument is any time change is introduced into the system the Protestant establishment must be a piece the first guy to be elected president who was not Protestant not the first to run now Smith I think was a good Catholic
 if the first successful nonprofit was John Kennedy
 so what is it about John Kennedy that appeals to the status quo he's not Protestant Catholic but he's male and his wife so the white maleness appeases The Establishment when change is introduced into the system something about the person that represents the first
 change in the status quo
 there's an appeasement factor that goes into a Dead Kennedys appeasement Factor was his white maleness
 the first African-American on the Supreme Court not Clarence Thomas who sits on it now he was a second first African-American Supreme Court is Thurgood Marshall he was appointed in night in the sixties you could look this out and Thurgood Marshall is a black guy
 but he's a guy and interesting Lee enough Episcopalian
 from Arizona
 Sandra Day O'Connor first woman wanted by Richard by Ronald Reagan what's up with her she's a girl first one and Episcopalian
 so there's this appeasement factor that Davidson is noting throughout this
 first African American woman in the president's cabinet
 first African-American with the president's cabinet occurred in the presidency of George W bush anybody know that I'm talking I'm talking about
 first African American woman in the in the president's cabinet
 Condoleezza Rice exactly very interesting person you were talking about who these people are what it is about them that boat is both appealing and in a sense of appeasing Condoleezza Rice as an academic you know started out as though it's got a PhD in political science wound up on the faculty at Stanford wound up in her late 30s I think certainly no more than her early forties Provost at Stanford University that means that she is the chief academic officer appointed whiz-bang us universities in the US or in the world Provost at Stanford whines up holding two offices in the bush cabinet she started out as National Security adviser and became Secretary of State in amazing skill set and a tremendous career and if you are and African-American woman and water role model you could do a whole lot worse in fact all the rest of us could do a whole lot worse for role model
 especially for academics
 Presbyterian and we're darn proud of her actually turns out she worked her way through school as a Church musician she's also a gifted keyboard piano stand organized
 so Condoleezza Rice is I think of No Tan on this argument now there was a time where this theory of Davidson's had an interesting twist to it in the run up to the 2008 presidential election the Democratic party there were two leading candidate and neither of which were white males and it became clear that the nominee for the Democratic presidential nomination was going to be someone other than a white male African American man I was going to be a white woman is it going to be Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton
 and Davidson and I were talking about this so we were at a conference in the run-up they were saying it's going to be interesting to see which appeasement factors play out Barack Obama's African-American but he's a guy and he's Protestant establishment Hillary Clinton is a woman she is white and she's Methodist not processing establishment well for reasons that I certainly can't Proclaim are causative the nominate became Barack Obama the black guy black guy and served for 8 years
 and now I mean this to sound I mean this to be less energy than it sounds
 but I think and play and if you read the article who would like to Trump you will at least sense
 there is a level of plausibility to what I'm about to say that is one of the many many factors that wound up giving Donald Trump a razor-thin electoral Victory there were a total of 60000 votes are so in Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin that flip those States for Donald Trump very small numbers of people that died in the electoral votes cast by 3 million
 there's a plausible theory that at least enough of a proportion of the American electorate said after 8 years of Barack Obama
 we want the white guy status quo back
 and that's what we got in a dinner at the may not have met her now I will also have to Hillary Clinton was a deeply flawed competing Canada and lots and lots of ways I mean the the Personalities in personal autobiographies and histories of both of those candidates were in play I think more so than in many other elections and we'll see what happens you know in the next run up here but I think at least Davidson's appeasement Factor argument is in play that partially explains the somewhat surprising among many many other factors 2016 presidential election in some way after 8 years of a departure from the status quo
 that way at least have representing the status quo at the top of the political process today the status quo again
 there's a charger that I want to show you that will just tell you a little bit about the religion of each u.s. president that's
 present presents religion this is a one-page thing I we have both Barack Obama and Donald Trump on the Protestant establishment side Donald Trump is a presbyterian Barack Obama as a ucc-1 Catholic three presidents that had no religious affiliation two of these are in arguably among our most notable presidents Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln
 claimed no religious affiliation Jefferson was much more of a of a pragmatist kind of a scholar Lincoln had a spirituality about him that I think he would have called transcendental if not overtly religious and then we have you know three or four Baptist if you methodists on George W bush interesting is a method but he was raised by New England Elite who are Episcopalian the Bush family from Maine are Episcopalian George W bush with his family to Texas to get into the oil business and wound up in Midland where he met a librarian named Laura Welch who is Methodist and he became Methodist like a lot of people become something other than what their original identity was they married somebody and decided that for the family's sake they would pick one and interesting to me in the run-up to the construction of the George W bush
 the library which is on the SMU campus in in the Metroplex you should go there the 9/11 the 9/11 Memorial part of his library is really quite stunning but the two finalists for where this really you can automatically beneficial reality with land we're SMU and Texas Tech Texas Tech was this was a semi finalists for where the George W Bush Presidential Library was going to be his father's libraries and the A&M Campus Linda Johnson's is on the UT campus
 and I knew immediately that it was Tech was not going to with it was going to go at SMU Laura Welch Bush Methodist easy but on the face of it that's what I thought and just as a little aside here if you want to go there and you using GPS I love what GPS and you know computerized voices tell us
 we were told something like this in a quarter of a mile turn left on smooth Boulevard
 smooth SMU
 small Boulevard questions
 okay thanks very much we got economy on Thursday and a test a week from today
