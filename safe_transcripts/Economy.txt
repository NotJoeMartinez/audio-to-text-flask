good morning everybody
 but we wrap up segment 5 with regard to class presentations and V exam which may be from any of you the last exam you take will be Tuesday and again Haley will have a review in the media and communication building room 281 on Monday at 4 going again over my standard announcement for the end of the term you will have a provisional total of points after V exam and there will be a Greg Abbott day left to get I will tell you that that will come out of the last segment of the Greg Abbott day from one of the two lectures that you'll have in class in the last segment
 you can either add for if you plan on being there or just assume you know the story that you have is what you have that will tell you a whether or not you have an A and need not take the final and that's totally up to you and coming to class those last two days is also totally up to you just as it always is all semester you may also learn that you have a total your you may not be happy with but it won't help to take the final
 you may have 220 points let's say and that's enough for Abby but your lowest score is 35 and you can't beat that 35 by enough points to earn the a so again if you don't need to take the final or you could have visual total and a lowest test score that is beautiful and you could earn the next grade example I use if you have 240 points assuming the last Abbot for example and your lowest test scores 40 you need just to get a 43 on the file and that would hurt you the A-Okay everybody get that I did send you an e-mail yesterday because my schedule changed a little bit after today's lecture and Tuesdays exam there are three class periods left in the semester one will be a week from today and that lecture will be here and done in person on the topic of collective behavior and you don't want to miss it it's just music so you want to make sure you mark your calendar for that
 then a week from Tuesday is the Tuesday before Thanksgiving November 26th turns out I need to be away that day and that was also true last semester on that particular topic for a variety of reasons and and all of that is that you don't need to know any of that that means that they will not occur that there will be no class on that day Tuesday November 26th the week of Thanksgiving I know that breaks all of your heart's right half of yours anyway so it doesn't matter already got the plane tickets had him since August you know that the audio of that topics of that leg of the topic for that day population community is already up you can listen to that at your leisure now you need to know that that was recorded a year ago so the announcements for that day that are on that recording are not right so
 you need to pay attention to the fact that the final exam in this class I believe is on Saturday of finals week at 7:30 in the morning I think that's how it works but you have to check that out then the last day of classes which is the last day of the semester December 3rd will have to lecture and social change schedule a room I'm dead day what we usually try to do is ask Haley to try to run away with you during class time on Thursday all I'm dead. I'm sorry I did a is Wednesday I think the 4th and so will try to do that now she has access to this room nobody should have scheduled it so we'll try to run a review for the final on dead day during the last time that make sense
 so that's the plan everybody sort of get it cuz I called these final matters and I want to make sure that everybody gets it I mean you're going to get an email with all this stuff in it anyway and inevitably I will still get an email from a student Undead day when's the final
 how do I know what I'm doing in the class abused hang in there figure it out
 are there any questions
 yes
 you cannot keep all of your test grades I know that would be great but your tests your score in the class is figured on the basis of five exams and 5 exams in 5 Abbott days so the pin whatever your five best exams are that's out that those are the five that will come okay
 okay today is the last of the three what I call interest-based social institutions these are the components or portions of our culture big pieces of society that serve our interests and today is by and large a flashcard kind of lecture got lots of terms lots of Concepts that kind of thing so let me just start by talking about the economic system which is the social institution and we have six of these the social institution through which goods and services goods and services iPhones and sociology lectures two most important things in your life social institution through which goods and services are produced
 distributed and consumed we produce stuff we put it out there for people to buy or in some way have access to and then consumers consume them in some way
 social institution through which goods and services are produced distributed and
 consumed
 Monopoly is the control of a market by a single business firm Monopoly control of a market by a single business from these are generally illegal because if only one entity provides a good or service that is especially useful they can sell it for whatever price they want and people will just have to buy it now what's ironic to me is that the among the very few legal monopolies are public utilities and they sell things like electricity natural gas and water which everybody needs they are regulated by the government but there are monopolistic the other Monopoly example other than the great game that you play over Thanksgiving break you know with your family everybody get together let's play Monopoly yeah
 any any bend the rules you know you put money in free parking five hundred bucks to start the game right and then you could be dead broke and then there's $2,000 in free I digress right we bend the rules all the time I might point out passenger rail service is a monopoly in the US we have one that runs passenger trains Amtrak and the reason we only have one entity that does that it's because they lose money hand-over-fist it is not by any means cost effective to run passenger rail service in a country that is as large and topographically diverse as the United States
 much cheaper to do it in Europe cities are closer together lots of people ride the trains on the other hand we had declared it so by the people we elect to fund and Trac and Trac it's a lot of government subsidies to stay in business
 that the fact that people have a relatively inexpensive
 reasonably reliable way of getting across the country is important to our culture so we innocence payforit taxpayer-subsidized the passenger rail Monopoly control the market by a single business firm generally illegal and there are some exceptions
 social surplus and we'll talk more about this as I move through the different types of society's economic forms and pre and post industrial society it's a production of goods and services to cultures own needs
 we produce or grow enough corn to feed everybody but we've gotten good at it so we grow more than we need so we can sell that corn and we can use the money to pay other people to do things other than farming sort of a convoluted way of describing a visit the definitions production of enough goods or services to meet a culture's own needs and have extra to sell
 and the reason this definition is important it will become the Tipping Point for a more complex economy's once a culture gets good at producing more than they need they create a commercial economy
 so once again the definition of production of enough goods and services to meet a culture's own needs plus extra to sell
 finally laissez-faire is French term and I can't pronounce it correctly but it's translated let them do let them do as a form of capitalism with in which there is minimal if any government intrusion laissez-faire is the bait is at its ass or philosophical concept it's the basis for a Libertarian political ideology leave me alone let them do fair enough now that sounds like a great idea and it's appealing in many ways and in Practical terms it works itself out but we really don't want we don't want the absence of government interference with regard to food safety and Drug safety right so we need some of this the question is how much and Ronald Reagan and part was elected on a platform of deregulation also in play in the run-up to the election of Donald Trump we will deregulate government interference and that's what laissez-faire is about
 got a question
 it generates the social surplus is a sort of an evolution of skill in a culture and when that culture can produce enough of everything it needs for its L + more than they can sell that to other cultures in exchange for other things and that creates a complex economy okay
 what else
 alright let's talk about sort of the evolution of Economics the simplest form of social arrangement in a society which is you know both culturally and economically driven
 they're two jobs in a hunting and Gathering Society for a shiny new dime what are they hunt gather Manhunt women gather equally valuable and there's almost no stratification in hunting and Gathering Society quick little digression find it on Netflix or Hulu or someplace a movie called The Gods Must Be Crazy came out 30 years ago you know what I'm talking about it's a wonderful movie isn't it the setup is this hunting and Gathering Society in sub-Saharan Africa roughly 500 miles from Johannesburg down in the southern part of that continent and in the movie a private plane gets off course and flies over the village and they never seen a plane there and what this thing is then what kind of bird this might be and carelessly the pilot dumps a glass Coca-Cola bottle and it be Coca-Cola bottle out of the plane that lands in the middle of the village
 well these are simple folk that believe everything in the world that they need is provided by the gods and the gods have provided them this thing I have no idea what it is they pick it up and start to wonder why we do it this are eminently practical they learned very quickly that it can be used to grind corn into meal that's a good thing for it it can be used to tan leather you know it's got an interesting shape to make music with it and they get there if they just find a thousand things that seems that they can do with this coke bottle such that it becomes the most valuable resource in the village
 at which time people want to get it to use it while other people have it and it creates tension that's the definition of War by the way competition for scarce resources and finally someone who has it discovers that can be used as a weapon and wax the person who wants it over the head with it and then everything stops in the village like this is no one has ever struck another villager much less with any ever
 The Gods Must Be Crazy while it's just a sort of a metaphor about the sort of the end well you know started getting getting capitalism dropped into your culture and what some of the consequences of that are so The Gods Must Be Crazy
 find it for $0.50 or however much it would cost and it's worth worth a good look at this hunting and Gathering Society to get invaded by capitalism
 Horticultural societies are more stable hunter-gatherers tend to have to move around a little bit they tend to be nomadic in some sense and that's because you can only hunt out and gather up to a limited degree but Horticultural societies are those that these are the people are becoming gardeners for planting they discover that within the vegetables or plants or foodstuffs that they grow there are seeds and you can plant them and thought of those seeds come more things from from from the God doesn't work
 tell her to cultural societies are Planter's and gardeners they grow much of what they need and us can stay in one place longer
 this is where the social surplus kicks in because gardeners get good at it and they learn to become Farmers where they can grow corn let's say and the neighboring Village can grow soybeans are cut and then they can grow enough corn such that they can feed everybody and have extra to trade for soybeans in, get the idea so this social surplus creates a more complex economy where we begin to see farming become the most valuable form of work these are pre-industrial societies and they evolve to the point where a social surplus creates the ability for people to trade what they grow cuz they grow more corn than they need but they need cotton so they trade or they develop a currency exchange where they sell the corn and use the money to buy cotton stuff like that make sense
 well
 we get good at doing this and we discover that not only can we grow things on the ground we can dig things out of the ground that may have nothing to do with what we can eat but they can fuel machines such that we no longer have to have horses to plow our Fields industrial societies we start making machines that replace
 human and four-legged
 Machinery if you will
 primary Industries are industries that extract raw materials and the examples of the supportive of a primary industry would be mining and ranching and farming we extract raw materials from the ground or we capture animals and we
 rattlin tree farm animals if you will livestock farming
 and Mining are examples of primary Industries
 secondary Industries extract
 taper on materials and convert them to finished products the textile industry is the secondary industry they take cotton and turn it into blue jeans today secondary industry would be refining taking oil and turning it into gasoline and so on so they take raw materials and turn it into a consumer product or finished product sell services
 retailing warehousing teaching all of these things that sell a service we have acquired knowledge or having a built-in infrastructure we don't feel or we don't create or gather up or extract anything we take what has been extracted has been refined or in some sense turned into a sellable product and we create the infrastructure for buying and selling so warehousing retailing education Healthcare are all tertiary Industries
 well we get so good at producing and serving that
 we start building a kind of machine that doesn't build anything
 but that stores and retrieves information in a post-industrial society
 will an industrial society the most valuable commodity or machines and that machines replaced land and slaves
 in a post-industrial society the most valuable commodity is not necessarily the machine but the information in it the most valuable resources information this was the term industrial society was coined by a social thinker named Daniel Bell back in the late sixties he saw this coming that information would soon supplant Machinery has the most valuable resource in information when in fact maybe replace individuals that run machines my dad worked in the office he was an accountant at a firm that built engraving machines and these were machines that a skilled Tradesman who apprenticed and learn the skill of Engraving could do that you know and then there's lots of things not just trophies but many many other things are more Industrial
 well that company went out of business when the machines that did the engraving were replaced the machines hit man ran to do the engraving were replaced by machines that at computer control and that was sort of the start of that's to me that's just a memorable way of describing the Tipping Point when the games are controlled by computers Lasik eye surgery for example is not done so much with the skill of the hands of a trained surgeon but the way in which the surgeon can guide and manipulate a computer-controlled laser more and more and more surgical procedures are being done robotically and less invasive if you are using a robot arm or a robot and of something to remove a gallbladder for example you don't have to slice the person open wide enough to get your hand in
 that was one of the most amazing Evolutions in my lifetime of medical technology that illustrates how computer controls can change lives
 when I was in seminary there was a guy that was a medical resident that had his gallbladder removed in the old-fashioned way and I watch the gallbladder surgery one time and I knew why it took people two weeks to recover from it I was standing on a stool looking over the shoulder of the surgeon who was removing a gallbladder and he took his hand and sort of went elbow deep in the guys abdomen it was so that's why it hurts
 the early nineties I developed a way of doing this by just punching a hole in the abdomen and going in and sort of sucking out the gallbladder and the first person I knew that had gallbladder surgery that way was a guy that was 93 with a parishioner in my church and somebody told me he's going to have gallbladder surgery I say that's going to kill him it's going to kill he will not survive the oh no they're doing it this new way over and done in Indianapolis really Hospital in one night unbelievable you know after a two-week stay with a nose NG tube in a huge mass in enormous pain that's the kind of thing that generates the Tipping Point toward information and how information storage and retrieval systems can change our lives
 for the better I'm not so sure the extent to which our lives are run by computers is pretty pretty extraordinary this how I called customer service I think it was
 can't remember what it was I think it was a a car insurance issue I think and I called the customer service people and told them that they had double billed or they've been billing me for insurance on a car that I no longer own when I sold the car and inform the insurance company they didn't get the memo soap like two or three months I kept getting this insurance bill and we'll have to look into that will have to fly like a can't you just take it off the bill and this was the answer the computer won't let me do that
 who's ever heard that from somebody and they expected you to believe them and take it seriously
 I'm sorry Dave I can't let you do that that's a movie reference look it up
 who runs the computer and the supervisor override but the Frontline answer computer won't let us do that
 okay
 when you bring into a wall like that with customer service just very politely and say would you mind if I spoke with your supervisor about this please and the person on the front line with Pope hell no I want I want rid of you so it will Turf you to some one of these have a polite conversation going with you on the person that was giving you the line that's good just read it off a card so just talk to somebody who is willing to talk to you is hard to do my point is it's harder and harder to do that get back to your notes
 come on I got to make flash cards start giving me the important stuff wait a minute
 okay I'm ready now
 post industrial societies where our societies within which information replaces Machinery is the most valuable resource which is great news because the Nerds win in the end the Nerds when asked Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos
 from a conflict point of view however
 the more things change the more they stay the same
 if we evolve from a culture where the most valuable resources are land and slaves to a culture where the most valuable resources are machines and laborers to a culture where the most valuable resources information and it guys girls
 all of that changes the content
 but not the form of social arrangement we just have different most valuable resources and most valuable resources are always scarce and they tend to stay where they are it reproduces inequality in fact Maven exacerbated
 we have lost hundreds of thousands of entry level jobs because we no longer need switchboard operators my grandma made her living doing that
 we don't need switchboard operator we don't even need bank tellers to the same degree that we used to cuz most of our banking is done online we do for ourselves by accessing computers
 enormous numbers of jobs that once were done by real people at low wages and so those jobs have been replaced but by people who have needed to have more skill and is we've already said that the acquisition of skills is not equally available
 so the conflict critique of this sort of evolution of economies and evolution of of a technology is it actually makes any quality worse
 it widens the Gap it heightens the Eiffel Tower
 let me talk about a very weird thing secondly that has evolve is almost a philosophical issue not so much an economically and post-modernism
 post-modernism by definition and once you define it you run afoul of it because the definitions are boundaries
 post-modernism is the diffusion of boundaries the blurring of or the fragmenting of boundaries
 used to be when you wanted to make a plane reservation you had to call a travel agent for the travel agent would access the computer I don't think anybody in just garden-variety I got to go from here to Chicago in 6 weeks use as a travel agent for that purpose you might use a travel agent to book a flight to take you on a Mediterranean Cruise or something like that but
 those boundaries have been diffused now you don't even have to go to Italy to experience Italy we not have virtual tours okay it's not the same
 you know what you might call up and get takeout from Orlando's
 and then you know fire up on your big screen
 a browser app and check out the Vatican
 you know maybe play some music in the background you could do that kind of thing I may have mentioned this to you before but it was a stunning day but I was a librarian in grad school I was how I work my way to a research assistantship in the am not in the library for protocol HTTP and the first sight that we have is the Smithsonian and look what we can see from there you know and then there was National Geographic website they were among the very first to give us a chance to experience something virtually that we couldn't know that we could go and see but it would be harder and now virtual reality
 will become reality and they already
 the diffusion of boundaries it plays itself out in a couple of other interesting ways in art and music I want of these weird kind of people that really likes when I go to a fancy art museum in Chicago for example I'm the one that wants to go first to the modern art area and almost nobody else does they want to see the Grant Wood American Gothic they want to see all the other famous paintings of the Mona Lisa at the Louvre or whatever you know. Just off center that's what I want to see
 the kind of thing that where you go there with your mom or your Uncle Frank
 he would go or she would go out I could do that
 and I say kind of wish you had look at the price tag on that thing
 my favorite modern artists and he's modern is you know mid-twentieth-century is Jackson Pollock anybody ever heard of this guy
 is the guy that sort of invented splatter painting died drunk and broke his errors are doing very well
 for canvas out on the floor 15 cans of paint different kinds of brushes dip them in the paint just kind of do this
 and
 you're right anybody could do that without the kind of skill it takes to make the smile just so at them on the Mona Lisa
 but it's different there's a Jackson Pollock in the Dallas Museum that just sort of not too far from the NC walk in and I can't tell you exactly but it's within 30 seconds there's this may be 10 ft high and 2 ft wide Jackson Pollock and I like to go up to it right here and just absorbing you know I get a sense that sometimes the chaos I feel in my life there's somebody that gets that there's a sense of empathy I get from Jackson Pollock I don't know
 what's a good wine you know when you got you got
 snobs in your life that can tell you all about poke a nose and palate and all God knows what people that are into this stuff think about wine and whiskey in all manners of other things
 a good wine good whiskey is one you enjoy has nothing to do with how much it cost unless you really like telling people that you paid $75 for a bottle of wine I did that once I bought a bottle of wine back from Italy and paid 75 Euros for you last week and it was really good and it was different than most of the other wine I drank but it wasn't $55 different enough from the best wine I ever had to want me to buy a second bottle
 the diffusion of found in other words art quality excellent music is kind of what we say it is the precursor of post-modernism was w i Thomas who said what we perceive is real becomes real end of story Yoko Ono's music
 music
 don't buy it go to iTunes and click on the samples and just listen to the screeching and the scratching and the howling and you will either
 read be repelled by it or you will be drawn to it in the same way that people like me are drawn to Jackson Pollock's are it will make you feel something that you walk away from in some way edify away from something being at a fight even if it's just bothers you bothers the heck out of you that's why we are horror movies thrillers
 post-modernism is a way of describing
 reality that you can't fully describe but that makes you feel something is it art is it music while as soon as you try to call it that you sort of run afoul of post-modernism once again examples and again it if it seems like that's not very Concrete in the way of describing it that's by Design because you can't describe post-modernism concretely do they run the post-modernism he's in theory class that sort of it
 what I just said is that sort of yeah we can talk about it but we wouldn't get anywhere right so I actually had a very witty Theory professor in grad school who said a postmodernist is someone who will listen to you describe the theoretical perspective and then denounce it
 denounce it is essentialist right
 basically it means anything goes
 and it started legitamate anything goes so that's the critique of it okay about anything I have said these are largely flashcard kinds of things
 okay let's then talk macro micro
 and that lets you talk Mac reminder
 oh I'm sorry shirt
 sure the agrarian society is pre-industrial and these are the farmers these are the ones that have gotten good plowing plowing furrows in planting and then the industrialist come in and say Hey will sell you a combine oh boy you know that kind of thing so this is pre-industrial and then generates the energy to think up what was he found this black stuff coming out of the ground I wonder what we could do with that hey it if you light-headed you can like that on fire let's try to channel the fire into an internal combustion engine and off we go right
 other questions
 from a functionalist point of view let's just talk about
 the workaday world having a job having that job be at a place that's connected to the economy maybe you work for a multinational corporation maybe you work for a restaurant chain maybe work for a small single-family entrepreneur type job what's that about
 we've already talked about this so I don't want to belabor the point with regard to work employment and the economy this is a partnership between education and commerce you all have pondered I suspect what can I do here in college that will qualify me to make the kind of money I want
 what are the high paying jobs and clearly the business school the engineering school in the architecture school draw a lot of students because these are highly skilled high paying jobs that get jobs coming out of those places develop
 fixing a very well skilled and very thoughtful and all that you get a lot of money for doing that
 sociology major English major philosophy major maybe not so much
 the point here is that in a functioning culture the educational system primary secondary higher ed is the process by which we get engineers and Architects and mathematicians and philosophers sociologist
 health care providers
 painters gardeners
 all in between a place for everyone and everyone in their place find something you can do that will earn you the money that you can live now
 stepping away from either theoretical perspective and sort of going this is your Dutch Uncle Jerry here just with a little word of advice but I've learned the hard way
 the answer to the question where do you want it where do you see yourself in 10 years is not answered as directly by the question what do I want to do what do I want to do
 the larger question is how do I want to live how do I want to live I will tell you from personal experience I wanted to do Parish Ministry I could talk I could relate to people I have a good heart all I kind of stuff and I sailed through Seminary got a very good job and became very good at in many ways and also terrible and other ways doing Parish Minister and I wound up in a church where there were 400 members which meant I had 400 bosses
 and after about four or five years of that I decided I don't want to live this way I want one boss essentially but I want that one boss to be me I wanted a time and if I how can I do that in ways that I spin a living still feel what I'm able to do you know I'm not going to be a carpenter cuz I'm not good at that but I want it is it's given me a life that I could not have otherwise even imagined with regard to autonomy I pretty much get to decide what I do with my day with the exception of but that's only 3 hours a week I can live with that actually I kind of like it
 Thomas song and dance
 I like performing the point is how do you want to live
 that's the first question
 what do you like to do is the second question and who can pay you enough to do that that you can live how you want
 I mean you can I was going to I was pretty mad and to be real honest with you I think I could have made a good position if I didn't have to learn so much science
 I could have done the white coat bedside thing I have to ask somebody else that what's the dosage for that I can't remember and why
 how do you want to live if you want to live 95 in a cubicle maybe fine work in a factory next to a guy that thought he had the greatest job in the world he all he had to do all day long was one thing he knew really he was really good at doing it it was repetitive he knew that when his Day started
 he could do the one thing you learn how to do well and he knew that at a very precise time as they would end and he could forget about it he like that he wanted to live that way all manners of types all right for the functionalist perspective
 the educational system and aptitudes and interests create
 a place for everyone and the culture creates the opportunities to get that so that's sort of
 from a conflict point of view borrowing insights from post industrialism
 now this is a macro deal conflict theory but sort of like the sick role illustrates a functioning issue
 alienation illustrates a conflict issue Marx argued even in the late 1800s something that I think a lot of us would resonate with that what I do on my job working for this multinational corporation I have no direct connection to the end product I'm the one that answers the phone and then connection you know that you call a hotel for a reservation thank you for calling Marriott Houston how can I help you I'd like to make a reservation I'll connect you
 the person who answers the phone is different from the person at the front desk is different from the person who takes the reservation and in a lot of change now if you call the hotel itself and you have to make a reservation they will connect you to the corporation's reservation system which maybe in another country
 and there are all manners of people at every stage of the game here
 and going to work in a job of that sort
 is what's marks referred to as alienation where an individual is connected is disconnected to the product of his or her labor and the culture that needs or values that later
 it started the start of durkheim turned inside out durkheim argued that someone who flips Burgers and Fries chicken is connected to the larger society and can be at peace
 a night marks would agree at least you can see the chicken wing or the hamburger you know but Mark's would argue that a person who works as a chief assistant to an assistant chief or something similar to that we're just on an assembly line you know I put the widget here and someone else you know as it work from the product and it creates a sense of isolation
 and further these kinds of jobs tend to be done by people with lower skills and lower opportunities so that's kind of the conflict hay on working employment
 it's actually a lot easier to talk about this on a micro-level because we have jobs we want jobs we know people with jobs of the sort that we want
 we tend to think of jobs in two categories I have an occupation in other words I do something for money that occupies my time not something I want to do for the rest of my life but I can learn something coolest cool occupations that I had where I learned something about people in my world and in fact the two jobs I would say that jump-started my sociological imagination where one I was a caddy at a country club for Rich snobs very very intriguing job there were people that treated caddies with
 with respect and we tried to ignore special song is playing the golf course for the first time and we knew you know if you if you slice it just that far offline 2:40 and you know you can't get there with a 6-iron really
 Etc and then there were those guys that guy's I reach Krista reach for a guy 7 hour one time after you just clanked it and he was holding on to it and I'm due to be going to the golf bag I'm reaching for the club he puts a club in my hand and then slams the thing down into the bag hitting my knuckle with the edge of the 7-iron right and then says not a word and I know people that I met people that have that same regard for underlings you can learn a lot in a in a job that occupies your time if you pay attention the other job that I thought was just and manage the charts and arrange the paperwork in a neurosurgery unit at the University of Chicago
 one of the high power and his heart's not in this Neurosurgical Department in the world there were literally people that came from all over the world to be treated by some of these doctors and then you know you get in the whole med student resident attending and all that kind of stuff is there are higher High Rockies I thought they were fascinating thing I remember the most it was Fourth of July weekend just as a little bit know if you can avoid going to a teaching Hospital in the first couple of weeks of July don't go a teaching Hospital like UMC it's a teaching Hospital
 the first week of July July 1st specifically is when fourth-year medical student become first-year residence with the tip of the clock strikes midnight in there now and MD resume
 first-year resident come second-year resident otherwise everybody is doing a brand new job for which there is high pressure and that they have to learn from experience and that they have none of it
 I was Fourth of July I was supposed to drive through a Sunday night to the ward wasn't very busy but the whole thing and just clicked over and there was a first-year resident that was on call I work the night shift first-year resident that was on call that night I remember his name and he came in and just kind of looking kind of glassy-eyed at me and we sit down and I'll go Hate You Know Carl what's going on he said A week ago I was in medical school
 and tonight I'm the neurosurgeon on call at the University of Chicago what that meant was if somebody came into the ER with a gunshot wound to the Head Carl's beeper went off and he was supposed to be the first one there like he knows what to do with the ER physician says we'll call The Specialist to specialist has exactly three days experience and of course the specialist is going to go down there and sending position position pretty darn fast
 but we have professions to which we have to evolve as it were so I could patients and professions that my job is a ward clerk in your window on that world that I never otherwise would have had and I was riveted it's part of why I became a medical sociology so anyway
 bad news for you is this lecture is almost over and there's lots of rooms for room for digression so crap I'm thinking up kind of on the Fly I'm just throwing it at you cuz I got time so just real. I'm not going to do much more that it's okay
 so they're two kinds of Labor two kinds of things we can do for money occupations and professions which typically require more education
 tends to require a certifying exam
 maybe even recertifying and you generally get paid more and you have more Prestige professionals have more Prestige than laborers as it were
 although I'll have to tell you in my experience in calling for and trying to get plumbers and electricians into my house they are suddenly the most valuable people in my world you know and God love they cost a lot you don't want to call a plumber that'll cost you a hundred bucks an hour watch try to fix it yourself great idea
 first time I tried that I broke something call the plumber and pay the plumber for 2 hours work that but for my screwing it up would have taken in 30 minutes how was that cost effective
 know thyself and extend value to the people who are skilled and trained and are worth ultimately what they ask for in exchange for that
 who's got a job that kind of like
 yeah just got a job that they go off I can put up with this for four more hours today and now I only have to work 4 hours and that's good kind of a crappy job
 what makes for job satisfaction what kind of entertainment is a whole sub sample of the sociology of work jobs
 pay and Prestige as you might think I made it has what it has a lot to do with that make no mistake pay and Prestige are huge you know enough to be comfortable with our do people value what I do and do they see me in positive ways pay and Prestige makes this job very satisfying autonomy best job in the world that I can think of you know I just have to know that if know what you have to know what but it is at for you how you want to spend your time
 a job can be satisfying if you have any kind of autonomy you know if people actually sometimes if your boss says what what do you think you're the one that does this job what do you think about this new innovation and then they listen to you that can makeup that can make a meaningful job really satisfy you know I work next to the guy was telling you about before that just love to 7 to 3:30 job cuz he was doing one thing I got asked to do that one thing and I'll ask the form and how to do it and ask Mickey knows how to do it so Mickey showed me how to do that and Mickey had a good day as a result of somebody asked for his advice and opinion and I learned how to grind rough edges off of machine parts and try not to grind my fingerprints off in the process anyway
 so some level of autonomy and decision-making and also just like the people you have to spend that for hours with who's got let me just ask would say you've got a job that's otherwise kind of crappy on paper but you're kind of like going to work cuz you get to spend time with someone so now they're fun to be around
 you pull pranks at work
 it had to do with the locker room in the padlock did they tell you this story
 listen I was actually trained professional this is my first job out of college I was going to open the Aquatic program director YMCA and I was on the professional staff made $8,000 a year which for 60 hours a week do the arithmetic not a lot of money for a lot of really hard work now
 part of my job was to network with the members which meant playing racquetball that was great we also play racquetball with each other in the staff to sharpen our skills and this was the kind of guy that he thought more of himself generally than he should have right he was proud of everything and it was all about him and I like them for other reasons but he was not the most liked guy on the staff but I like them he liked me so we play wreck anyway if it doesn't have this kind of thing but it's got the little wheels that you can like 1 2 3 454 think they said the coolest thing about this is you can change really quick and then you change it so he hooked the padlock unlocked on to his locker and went to take a shower
 it's going to be fun they just told me how to change the combination on his block and it's sitting there open
 change change change
 best day on the job ever before cell phones you couldn't text me I let him stood on there for about an hour
 a relationship changed
 I just got an even with him something he pulled on me you know that kind of thing I got up in the office here I ran it for a year I ran a bit where he would leave his office door open and go to the restroom or go to the main office for some reason which is always a bad idea
 and then I would put it someplace else in the complex just not put in the breakroom put it over the Xerox machine stick it in somebody else's mailbox that kind of thing and hide and seek with his with his doctoral degree
 who wants to who wants to get a job where you start working with me
 hey you know what that's the kind of thing that makes a crappy job good
 autonomy
 individuality nice people to work with
 and unemployment is a it can be devastating to your identity
 I mean there are jobs that you know you will be unemployed from summer jobs factory jobs I had I knew I was going to have a last day and pretty much knew when that last day would be
 but I also had jobs
 where I did not know what my last day would be and I was surprised the day I learned that that was today
 who's ever been fired I mean just plat out fire
 twice
 not your best day although one of them I was calling well fine
 but then you got to figure out what next to do with your life you know it's one of these major transitions because
 honestly I mean I wasn't I shouldn't say I was I was fired twice and from a job that was actually I thought three important I left in advance of Shirley getting fired fairly soon right
 and I literally remember coming home after I resign from that job and was going through drawers put in stuff when I found a stack of business cards that had listed me with the job I just quit and I thought what am I going to do with these and it was just sort of
 I used to be that until like two hours ago right and now who am I
 and you have to sort of reshape who you are when you leave a job for whatever reason you know and that was the job for which I went back to I'm going to transitional job for a while then I'm going back to grad school at that moment where I found those business cards must have been maybe 3 years later I was on an airplane and I was flying to a conference I was in graduate school and I was flying to a conference like my fall conference that I tell you all about it was that year and I thought I was a grad student and I was sitting next to a guy on the plane and what what do you talk about on the plane if you taught well what do you do where you going I said I'm going to a conference oh yeah what's sociology conference in Washington DC
 and I have two choices I wanted to say yeah I'm a grad student and I'm pushing 40 pretty hard
 instead I said no I'm a minister cuz I was
 part time but now I'm not so I chose to not why cuz it was true but I chose to withhold the truth I said he didn't need to know that that those two things are not as deeply connected as you might think but I let that but I remembered I thought you had this little part time gig that pays you minimum wage to preach and visit hospitals and that was fine
 I put the point of this story is the thought process I went through a very cognitive process of asking myself how do I want it Define my identity in light of an unemployment matter
 on an airplane talking to a fellow professional and you start at the play that around in your head so once again w i Thomas here we go
 nothing at all
 for the functionalist point of view the educational system in the economy are partners and one feeds the other and then also retraining and so on their Partners in society
 I got nothing else thank you very much
