good morning everybody the last class was plagued with technical difficulties so we're going to hopefully get through this in one piece on culture and you were listening to three rather renowned one most widely known West Texas singer-songwriter's the last singer in the set of 3 how was Mac Davis who is somewhat infamously known for writing a song called Lubbock Texas in my rearview mirror it was initially regarded as a disrespectful song but if you listen to it it's quite not how the middle song was sung by a songwriter named Terry Allen who wrote a song that's been covered by lots of famous people called Amarillo Highway sounds local does it not in the first singer was a guy named Joe Ely who sings with a group called The Flatlanders guys that sort of invented a sound in the seventies in Lubbock and that song app
not that much has changed and Joey Lee wrote it when he came back to Lubbock and found that not that much has changed
 West Texas Music there's that and is also another link on the front end of the my personal website to other West Texas music singer-songwriters that you might want to listen to if you want to get involved in the culture okay Dad joke
 what did the left eye what did the left eye say to the right eye
 something smells between us
 worthy of all your dad's okay right this is the last lecture in this segment and the test the first test in the class and will it be your first college test on Tuesday
 I will be on on Tuesday at this hour you will need a number 2 pencil and an orange Scantron with 5 answer choices and I know you go to the bookstore I don't know where else you can get American vending machines in Ellsworth and that's about it anything other than that there's a review that Haley the full-time ta will run on Monday at 4 in the mask on building room 281 there's a schedule of all of the reviews and they're on the on the website I know that doesn't meet with everybody's schedule and if you can't make it at 4 on Monday you can take your notes that you're in effect writing your own study guide look where there's gaps and go back and consult the audio files and you should be able to get it
 I will also entertain questions on content right before we distribute the exam fair enough
 the review is in the mask on building room 281 and you're just going to have to look up where that is I can't give you that I can't give you directions
 the mass communications building mask on
 281 room 281 Mass, it's the big lecture hall that is sort of obvious when you walk up the steps in that building
 any other questions
 so we're sure okay
 this electronic culture sort of wraps up a lot of introductory ideas self Society macro micro in the research methods piece front end just to help you understand that we actually test this stuff and where we come up with it but culture is buying large everything we do everything we know everything we teach everything we believe it's just a Theory of Everything
 Centerpoint is most all cultures have things that are common to all cultures but usually in very different ways even moving around and getting from here to there in one particular place or another is different depending on where that is how many of you when you came to Lubbock you thought this was a Backwater small Cowtown on the edge of nowhere and you're all from the Metroplex or someplace like that Houston San Antonio right point of view on Good Ole Lubbock Texas
 all cultures have the same things or at least a list of the same things we all have our language of some sort we all have food Customs we all have a religion we all have burial burial Customs funerals and so on Rites of Passage marriage childbirth and so on or as we used to call it in Theological Seminary that the ministers who are the keepers of the religious rituals our job was to hatchin match him and dispatch him I was at 2 is that too Cavalier
 for a man of the cloth
 there's also something known as cultural diffusion that is we learn and Export and import
 aspects of other cultures ethnic restaurants would be a good example although there are Asian restaurants in the US where you can buy Asian food that you can't buy in Asia as it were and let me just by a show of hands how many of you regard the United States of America as a foreign culture who would say that your friend somewhere else okay very good thank you
 kind of weird and it will different especially in the south
 let's talk about elements of culture clearly one of the most difficult things to overcome if you go to live in a culture different from yours is the language and I'm not only talking about different countries across oceans later in this lecture I'm going to give you a language piece in cheese hat from Wisconsin and why do you want huh what sounded like an English word but as it were
 language is foundational to culture it is the essence of what defines a culture technically it's just a symbol system that people use to communicate a symbol system now those symbols can vary dramatically they can vary and what they look like alphanumeric characters or a kind of Arabic script that goes in the quote on quote wrong direction Asian characters that look like pictures and so on
 what's the symbol system of the language of the United States of the English language what is the symbol system what is it
 ABCDEFG now I got the stupid song and my Prof can't sing at all
 got it in your head called an earworm thank you very much. It's going to be with me for a week
 it's a say it's a common tune it's the same tune as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
 I know I learned that about 5 years ago and my wife was stunned like if you didn't know that how many in this room own up to it did not know her at every thought that the alphabet song and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star was the same tune who's with me on that thank you I appreciate that baba black sheep the same tune
 so I got it in your head..... I could have given you Achy Breaky Heart
 that song is 30 years old does it still suck
 so you don't even know what it is. You're lucky
 Billy Ray Cyrus who gave us Miley
 and achy breaky heart
 get back to your notes dumbass
 that's called a backfire now you can't have either of them in your head
 where are you going after class doc I'm going to Disney World
 here's the point
 language this is a linguistic argument it's a linguistic perspective if you study Linguistics you'll come you'll hear more about this call the sapir-whorf hypothesis
 they're going to hear is that language not only and maybe not even most importantly describes things
 but the way we use language determines
 what will happen next that the way we choose to put words together has a determinant of effect not just descriptive that's the sapir-whorf hypothesis illustrate this I'm going to just make some stuff up now which happens more than you think of this class I'm going to hypothetically recite for you what might be plausibly the opening paragraph of the introductory textbook for loitering doctoring and clergy all right and you open up the introductory book three hundred bucks worth of inter a textbook this is the first paragraph might sound something like this listen carefully
 when preparing to cross-examine a witness the successful attorney will first consult the facts of the case
 Fuel and consult the relevant case law and the character is witness he then went.....
 Doctoring 101 when conducting a physical examination the successful physician will first consult a patient's medical history examined his symptoms and then conduct a physical examination moving from his eyes ears nose throat Etc
 clergy a 101 get tired of this
 when preparing to write his sermon the successful Minister will first consult
 the text on which is preaching in its original Greek or Hebrew he will then consult various English translations and relevant commentaries and then he will conduct himself in fervent prayer
 stop that sounded haphazard and just making crap up and to some extent it was but there was a piece of every paragraph that was chosen very carefully and explicitly to send all of you a message about every doctor every lawyer and every Minister what if all you knew was what I just said about doctors lawyers in clergy what would you know about them
 they consult okay fair enough. That more basic than that
 they're all men and how did you know that
 I did I only who said that by the way who Am I who am I talking to thank you
 you caught that did you catch it right away or does it take the third time
 set the concept is inclusive language and you've been schooled in this correct
 who decided that we could tell the stories of all people by calling it his story history
 you may have been taught in middle school yet today that it's convenient efficient dare I say functional
 to use masculine pronouns to describe all of humanity really you can do that yeah you shouldn't fact who who came up with that idea
 what kind of world do we live in if we all wake up tomorrow and everybody but you knows that we're going to take a history class
 that from time immemorial we described everybody
 in feminine terms
 her story her her hit Etc she
 hell no
 are any have any of the women in the room
 ever notice this and roll your eyes like okay go along and get along
 who's this just a matter of course and I'm used to it
 I would say I heard this before and it ticks me off just a little bit yeah you should know this I was in Theological Seminary reading a textbook just like that starting a 1978 ancient history ordained its first woman in 1971 so we're only 7 years out of the pioneers and in a class of 50 there were seven or eight women there were by the way the smartest of the bunch and when we had study groups which which one of the women Will consent to come into our study group cuz I really had it going for
 that year we took introduction to New Testament it was taught by a German old white guy German Professor who did not suffer fools lightly if you get to my meaning
 and he was lecturing about I forget what but he was using masculine pronouns because that's how he'd learned English
 and one of the women in the room politely raised her hand and said would you please watch your language which took him back because he thought she was accusing him of using profanity he didn't get it and when she explained it to him he said that's just Superfluous it doesn't matter get over it essentially I forget exactly what he said
 but that started a whole thing in our class about the value of inclusive land six or seven very brave women were calling Up release turn an old white fully tenured professors who had a lot of authority over them by the time we finished that was working its way into our way of speaking he she has her and so on
 and those women in my class we're not just trying to be politically correct oh my gosh I hate it when that happens just politically correct nonsense claptrap if you heard this argument
 I'm sick of being politically correct I just you know they weren't trying to do that
 they were trying to change the world literally literally because until 7 years prior they were trying to get into a club where no icky girls were allowed
 they were trying to change the world and I think that that's the nature of not just the sapir-whorf hypothesis but what it means to be precise and careful
 and inclusive in our language which may make for a more inclusive mindset
 it is a fairly lengthy piece on just one element of culture language the basic symbol system used for communication
 and the idea that the way we use words that only describes what we're doing but might determine
 what we're about
 shorter piece on symbols
 symbols of the shorthand we used to communicate we talked about symbolic interaction t-shirts jewelry stuff like that
 here's the Bob point
 the meaning of a symbol
 depends completely on where you find it
 the meaning of a symbol depends completely on where you find it so we were wearing Texas Tech T-shirts and sweatshirts and Garb that will mean something drastically different in College Station or Austin Texas but it does right here
 gestures somebody in the back anybody just yell out
 how am I doing
 okay okay you better okay unless I am in most of the Middle East
 and if somebody says something and I go
 I have an effect on anybody know what I just told him
 excuse me sir you remind me very much of the north end of a southbound camel
 write my right
 vastly different be careful what you know gestures are very important communicators of symbols and it depends completely on way or another example
 you should YouTube greatest baseball play ever something like that and what you will probably get really on Isabel is it something that occurred on a baseball field and in the in Major League Baseball that has nothing to do with a ball or Glover a bat
 this greatest baseball play ever and it tells us something about an American mindset occurred in I forget it was 74 one of those three years at Wrigley Field in Chicago and it occurred between Innings of a game being played by the Chicago Cubs between Innings three guys jumped out of the stands carrying a large American flag a can of lighter fluid and a lighter and settled into right-center field and started to set the flag on fire one of the outfielders playing for the Cubs that day Rick Monday who had a decent but pedestrian baseball career
 trotted over grab the flag went to the side and just gave it to somebody in the front row and the crowd went nuts cuz they had figured out what was about to happen starting to get horrified and Rick Monday made the greatest baseball player ever intriguing right
 I have a friend who's a lot braver than me that in 1980 right after the Iran hostage crisis have been resolved and we're still we're still messing with that
 was at this point in this lecture when he reaches behind the podium and hauled out in a roni and flag one of those birthday cake Flags you know paper and stick in their set it on fire whole class erupted they knew what the Iranian flag look like ye he then reached back and took out same thing American flag and just moved it this way and somebody just went nuts in the front row and literally tried to stop him from doing it right course like it or not
 the Supreme Court declared that burning an American flag is a sign of protesters discontent or even disrespect is protected free speech and military people if not the most most of them would say that I mean the argument is people fought and died for the Integrity that flag and they also fought and died for the freedom
 for people to express themselves
 and what's intriguing to me and where this digression is going igniting an American flag is I think it is rightly abhorrent to most patriotic Americans and should be to me too
 on the subject of it's not just what where and why we do things
 around Memorial Day on this campus members of the ROTC will gather at Memorial Circle and conduct a flag retirement ceremony at Memorial Circle all year get beaten up pretty hard by the west Texas wind and at some point is also disrespectful to display a wrecked flag so you have to retire them respect how do you do that
 what do you do
 yeah you set it on fire you do the same thing now a different run up as you say fold it up nicely that's true but if you're from Mars and want to know what it means to burn a flag in the US
 you get ambiguous data right unless you understand the culture that's the point all symbols and only can be interpreted in light of where you find them and why they're being displayed
 fair enough
 okay I'm sorry about your Uncle Norm now Uncle Norm get one of these
 he knows the rules
 when you're around him better not break up that's what are norms are types of normative Behavior not normal morality but normative another words coloring within the lines
 and there are three versions of norms of increasing intensity and I would say that most of us are governed or our behavior is Guided by and we mostly here to the set of rules that are collectively referred to as foulkeways these aren't rules that you're going to go to jail for breaking these are the standards of style and etiquette you're being polite now you're not interrupting you're doing what you at least said you would do you're here taking note wash
 somewhat different in France but none the less folkways standards of courtesy and politeness and I have invented a word to describe this in some greater detail is a hyphenated word h a t - etiquette hat etiquette Hannigan
 how many of you guys in the room are currently wearing a hat raise up your hands and be proud do any of you guys who might be rushing to the campus now to tell you that your mom was in a car wreck and you have to get that information and they bust into the room and they see you and before they give you that emergency information that we got an Uncle Norm like that
 why does Uncle Norm want you to take your hat off first of all you're in the building secondly there are ladies present correct and this is Texas
 so you guys are going
 me not now not ever who is not wearing a hat at this moment but has one with you and it's not wearing it because you're indoors and are ladies present anybody
 I want to talk just to the women now man you can eavesdrop women listen up
 hypothetically you get on an elevator
 there's one other person on the elevator and it is a man
 he is wearing a hat until you step on the elevator and then he takes it off who faints what
 who would find that somewhat surprising and hey you know what that's kind of nice who would expect it
 that's what I'm talking about guys all the guys in the room now pretend you're wearing a ball cap
 pretend also that when this class is over you're going to have lunch at the Chick-fil-A in the union with three other guys who takes your hat off for lunch
 four of you
 you're going to lunch you're having it with your new significant other at Chili's across the street take your hat off then a few more you're at the Texas Tech Club with your new significant other and that person's grandmother you take your hat off then
 who's still going he'll know I'm wearing that hat everywhere I go it's glued to my head
 I had dinner at the Texas Tech led the other night with my wife there were a couple of guys there with hats on I wanted to go over there.
 But they were a lot bigger than me
 what are the hats at Carhartt don't screw that guy
 Hackett how many women have a ball cap on right now couple of you that's not a hat it's a fashion accessory
 it's different for girls
 Chanukah is a carrier for a whole bunch of American culture it's just one of those things you can hang your hat on
 where does he come up with his crap
 what song about mores these are rules of up one level of intensity this is the stuff we write down Amore is tied to what we might call public morality although there's a judgement connected to that that's that's not necessarily and play these are important
 at least collectively the syllabus that stuff you read when you click I agree to the purchase agreement or whatever you know and you never read it those are mores you don't want to do all that stuff because if you if you violate one of those rules and then complain about the product they say you're playing by the rules you violated a rule
 isn't interesting little little piece here
 we in sociology invented the causes and consequences of diversity every two years everyone at Texas Tech including the sociology faculty including me has to take an online course on workplace civility hostile work environment sexual harassment Title 9 labor laws
 what are the ones that invented the need for that and if you watch the show madman madman you'll know why we need those rules we invented the need for the and we wrote the curriculum
 and I still have to take it every 2 years
 how dumb is that I can I just wait for the time to expire take the quiz done but if I if I had some point create a hostile environment in the classroom if I in some way overstep my boundaries with a student or a colleague or something like that they can say hey we told you not to do that you have no recourse and they would be right
 it's not like I didn't know I can't say hey I didn't realize I was against the rules yes you did like you wrote it get the idea it's so we can say to you
 you know the rules and we hold you to that
 same as a syllabus if you have a grievance with a faculty member the first thing that will come into play what's on the syllabus is this in keeping to the professor violate the terms of the rules and if she did you have a case otherwise forget it
 Morris
 stuff we write down stuff we refer back to to hold people accountable that's a good way to describe it
 a third level of intensity in the rules of behavior
 are called to booze and I can only think of two
 social rules that rise to this level
 at Abu is a rule that in any culture wear it to be violated to any extent at all
 the culture would crumble we would have pretty much no more no more cultural anthropologists have introduced the concept of what they call the incest taboo which is that
 universally and vehement Lee forbids sexual contact between two categories of people typically brothers and sisters and others for which that's kind of the initiation right into you know being a sexually active adult Ironclad oh my gosh I breaking that so that's one of the incest taboo
 I can only think of one other and this isn't in most textbooks the name Jeffrey Dahmer ring a bell Jeffrey Dahmer he's been dead for 25 years at least and I he was up a serial killer in Milwaukee he live 20 miles from where I grew up
 and he not only murdered several people but there was one other distinguishing feature to Jeffrey Dahmer's criminal history and what does that involve
 yeah that's the other two boo you know if you're a missionary a hundred years ago and you're trying to bring the New Testament gospel to A Primitive headhunting community and they invite you for dinner think twice
 as it were
 I mean that was horrible and Jeffrey Dahmer was convicted of many many homicides the ick factor in the story is Extreme and he was sent to let you view as it was sent a sentence to life in prison without parole Wisconsin does not have the death penalty that's why I didn't get the death penalty although he did he hadn't been in prison 5 years in another inmate killed him
 and that was not a day of high grief for me although and I'm going to refer back to this moment in just a second in the later part of this lecture although and I
 sort of sickly say this is the truth
 Dahmer died before anybody thought to ask him a question that I sort of wanted to know the answer to
 what do we taste like
 I did that on purpose and I will refer back to it in about 5 minutes
 mores folkways and taboos folkways just the kinds of things that normally govern our Behavior mores the stuff they hold us accountable to and we screw up suppose you got it
 Moray
 the second one call cannibalism
 I got the right that down you got it
 if we have rules in our culture we also have sanctions what are sanctions punishments for breaking them
 what the rules are you get rewarded if you keep the rules to get punished if you break through some of these sanctions are formal
 you can have a formal negative sanction
 20 years ago
 my wife got her first and to this point only speeding ticket ever in her life
 prior to that I got in 10 or 15 of them I used to get birthday cards from defensive driving.
 But when she got the ticket she became the incumbent Scofflaw in the family and I vowed that I would not get another ticket as long as I could hold that over head
 I have any idea I don't remember
 until about a year ago
 I'm back in the league defensive driving.com they said welcome back
 that's a formal negative sanction school zone
 right
 can talk my way I have talked my way out of it but it doesn't tickets in that 20 or time but that's another story
 anyway
 formal negative sanction formal positive sanction sometime this year I should get it'll be in my mailbox will be wrapped up I will get a 25-year lapel pin
 and I don't wear lapel pin so I'll give it a try the 20 or pain was I guess my picture taken with the present in the chancellor mean just stuck it out that's great it'll be a new present that's a positive formal sanction award
 we don't get a lot of that I mean good grades in school that's a positive could be positive that the formula should say could be positive or negative sanction most of our Lives by informal positive and negative sanctions and they're sort of obvious have you seen the what's the latest viral video of the two little two year olds that running running up to each other and giving each other a hug you seen that is just adorable that is an example of a positive informal so I am so glad to see you and two-year-old ate away with it
 when can you hug somebody at work
 never I mean typically so that's a positive informal sanction question about what we taste like you
 you groaned you looked at what the other way you indicated to me collectively that you were crossed the line on purpose because that is a negative informal cycle just another version of how we sort of
 deal with each other even the people we love dearly
 if I walk into the house and I go hey I'm back and I get the look
 I know I've stepped into somewhere but they do
 the look it's alright it's very powerful it maybe it maybe it's got a killer look at me I'm serious come on
 who has already today
 giving the look to somebody you care about who's done it already today who has who has who gotten it from somebody who plans to give scripting it when I see them they are still going to get looked at right now and then
 that's a very powerful mechanism of social control informal negative informal positive Etc
 Norms are the rules sanctions are rewards and punishments for keeping or breaking them
 values
 things we believe that by and large Define a culture
 that Define who we are collectively there are Scholars that have made lists of all American values these are the things that define the United States of America have to read the most beautiful open a cheese mint and success in college
 individualism
 I am who I am and that's all what I am
 activity and work science rationality material Comfort we strive for that
 freedom democracy education religion
 romantic love and monogamy new cultural norms that monogamy means one man one woman or partner for life and the degenerate and that the Genesis of that was love and romance essentially arranged marriages other kinds of it look up the word concubine or consort and look at its historical purpose women especially that fulfilled those rolls so that why I shouldn't have to if you could marry somebody for other reasons but you can sort of satisfy the other part with people who did that as it were okay but you should know that that's a relatively from the standpoint of
 okay history from the standpoint of History that's a relatively new idea given some of the other ideas we have
 those are just American values and every other country or culture will have similar values are similar list I should say for example in Finland in Scandinavia the value of making socially necessary resources available to everybody and basically having a massive tax rates to be able to do that is just another way of valuing people and what they need but it works differently in different countries and cultures
 so far I've given you several what might be considered flashcard material you know for Tuesday's festivities and I have another list of several others write down the the word on one side of a car door piece of paper and then the definition on the other and you can ask me again what that is before class ends or before the test or you can consult the audio tapes are the audio files tapes but there's no tape involved here that's a cultural thing
 questions so far before I get to the second list
 pilot talk about different
 variations of culture that lives by a different set of social norms and maybe Embraces a different set of values
 different because generally out of necessity most members of the military would say probably in others would say about them that that's a kind of subculture anybody in the military currently or formerly in there in the room military anybody
 is there a hat rules in the military to are they're not and are they different for men or women
 yeah see
 but you would would you agree that especially if you're in uniform you live by a set of different rules than just generally speaking your Incognito right now right so you had to own up to that but if you were in uniform people would see you differently you would act differently and you would see yourself differently right sort of in a different kind of culture that would be even more dramatically the case if you remember the US Navy and currently serving on a submarine right whole different set of things
 so that's one example of a subculture and counterculture and then loop back to this briefly Counter Culture is similar to a subconscious living by a different set of rules but those rule differences are in opposition
 two prevailing culture it's a subculture that lives in opposition to prevailing coaches call the counterculture now some would argue whether or not a same-sex couple would be a part of a subculture or counterculture a lot of it has to do with time and place some of it has to do with religion until recently it had to do with legality
 so there are categories of folks that live differently than the majority if you will and the question is how far out of step is that well if you go back to the Jim Crow South a lot of non Anglo people in this room with live very different why you wouldn't even be here cuz you wouldn't be allowed to be here Texas Tech was white only not by law but my custom University of Mississippi was white only almost by law you know so there's that so sometimes countercultural reality becomes cultural normative reality thank the stars for that
 right subcultures countercultures
 one more time to live with a different set of rules circus performers Rodi Road Rochelle entertainers polygamist Cults would be another example
 set a culture shock encountering unfamiliar elements of culture I didn't think I'd find that here
 like beer in a dormitory fridge
 who would say maybe in addition to that that since you landed at Texas Tech you have encountered something that was unfamiliar to you that you didn't quite understand and that would fit the definition of kind of culture shock what's going on here
 okay I promised you a language thing earlier in the lecture I'm going to say something I come get it I'm going to give you a directive I'm going to command you not to do something and I'm going to do it in cheesehead you're ready
 hey they're going to punch in line at the bubbler
 who's from Wisconsin from Wisconsin what did I just say
 yeah don't crowd the water fountain thank you but that's all later can I go to the bubbler
 yeah yeah
 weird huh that weird things in Texas to have y'all is just the obvious y'all's is pleural sou all has to be pluralized the second time right and then my favorite all y'all
 triple plural truck
 I love that
 oh man culture shock
 how many parallels next two terms are a little bit out of work on my parallel ethno and xenocentrism those are opposite terms to be ethnocentric is to regard elements of your culture whatever that is in for a lot of visits us culture but not everybody in this room it's to regard your culture as Superior to any other culture
 ethnocentrism
 has been sort of a academic type term for other kinds of centrosomes over the years or isms I should say racism sexism classism all of which are sort of ethnocentric ethno meeting people-centric meeting at the world revolves around me
 the exit if the axis of the earth goes through your body and everybody else
 just doesn't have the right Axis well that's ethnocentric
 a lot of it is diluted
 witness the diversity in this room versus the non diversity and a Southern University 60 years ago some of it's been diluted
 it really is the question that's been on point however there's been a Resurgence of
 maybe we should be more ethnocentric maybe we would be more functional
 safer more economically prosperous if we sort of resurrected someone put some of the teeth into ethnocentrism that's part of what's been going on in our culture over the immigration issue over the last two-and-a-half 3 years as it were that this might be helpful instead of hurtful pejorative divisive and cruel all of those other things so that's why America First is essentially ethnocentrism just without the judgement connected to it that's what it is
 xenocentrism would be the idea that elements of other cultures are superior to ours illustrate this between the theater opposite terms let me illustrate first another version of ethnocentrism and apply it to a xenocentric concept who either has or knows a fair amount about motorcycles
 what is the All American Motorcycle sir
 Harley at the Harley Davidson
 made by good Christians in Milwaukee Wisconsin
 actually I think they've now Outsource Harleys in the world shook a little bit when that happened
 oh my gosh I did not know that if you are a Harley afficionado what is the pejorative term the negative term for any other motorcycle
 what is it
 nope not dirt bike
 no that's a different kind of pejorative term this would be at this or something to do with the origin of the bike
 they're called rice burners
 because they're made by Suzuki or Yamaha are on Internet only know where there's something you should not use you go on blogs and Boards about motorcycle riders you will find this
 I brought a Honda to Lubbock
 and sold it within about six months one was for the dirty looks too was for the fact that I knew I'd be roadkill because of the way Lubbock drivers don't see motorcycles
 anyway but here's the interesting part
 we're talking about Vehicles made in Detroit another good Christian place
 as opposed to Tokyo or Seoul or some other place where they make Japanese or Korean cars
 I've got a there's a link on the website here
 that dumb we're having technical difficulties in the last class the thing wasn't working but
 I have American-made cars right here and the link is an index of the most American-made cars labor and parts the most American-made car is the Jeep Cherokee the second most American and the third and the fourth are Hondas
 been that interesting
 Honda is a multinational car corporation whose corporate headquarters is in Japan
 Acura isn't that a is that is that a Honda or is that a Toyota is that the Honda okay Honda how does making a lot of cars in the US and some of that money is going out of the US wait a minute.
 Let's not talk about free trade for a while okay look at all the Hondas in the list finally we've got a good GMC Canyon and a Chevy Colorado and then another and if you live in East Liberty Ohio you're mighty happy for them rice burners
 as it were I saw this kind of interesting that the most America at the majority of the 10 most American-made cars are made by Japanese car companies
 xenocentrism
 come into play as parallels and couplets
 anybody getting dizzy with this trying not to cultural relativism cultural relativism finally that is making a judgment about other cultures
 based on the other cultures values not yours
 I mentioned earlier in this lecture that monogamy and romantic love our relatively New Concept but arranged marriages happen in many many parts of the world and if you go and understand that culture from the inside you may come away going you know not my thing glad I don't live here but I understand why they do it I understand why it works that way that is a cultural relevance relativist point of view go ahead
 sure the definition is the understanding of
 another's culture
 through their from their point of view not yours it's just another way of saying walk a mile in my shoes that would be a cultural relativist perspective understanding another culture from the other cultures point of view not laying it on your not laying your deal on it and make sense
