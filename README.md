My professor uploads his lectures to a website where I can download them as a raw mp3 file. Listening to him talk is great but I find even when I do attend class and take notes I often miss important moments that end up on the test review. Because the recordings are just mp3 files I often find myself spending scrubbing through the recorded lecture looking for the definitions of key terms. This web app will be able to transcribe hour long lectures  so I can have the power of regular expressions (Control/Command + F) to help me with the process.
